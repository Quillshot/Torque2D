The File Hierarchy This image represents the hierarchy for the script files that we will be discussing in this reference manual. Please refer to it whenever a file location id mentioned. Starting the Game When the system first loads the game, the main.cs located in the /ProjectFiles/common folder is run. This file contains the function to run when the game is first loaded - using the onStart(); function, and the function to run when the game is finished shutting down - using the onExit(); function. Once the Main.cs file has finished loading into memory, the onStart(); will be automatically called, at the very bottom of the script file. When the onStart(); is run, it will execute the various game loading scripts, including: /scripts/game.cs - The launching point for the TorqueScript code unique to your game. /scripts/system/system.cs - The launching point for the TorqueScript code that manages file loading and system actions, unique for your game. When this loading has been completed, the function initalizeGame(); will be called. This function is defined in /scripts/game.cs. The initalizeGame(); function will call the startGame(); function. This function accepts the global variable Game::DefaultScene, which is the default .t2d file to load when the game is first launched. The value of the global variable Game::DefaultScene is defined in /scripts/system/defaultPrefs.cs near the top of the file. The default level that is loaded is data/levels/emptyLevel.t2d, however this can be changed to whatever the first level file you need to load for your game might be. The startGame(); function is located just below the initalizeGame(); function in /scripts/game.cs. At this point the first level will have loaded and your game has begun! M      ");

The language is very forgiving, easy to debug, and is not as strict as a low level language like C++. Observe the following line in a script: // Create test variable with a temporary variable %testVariable = 3; The three most simple rules obeyed in the above code are: Ending a line with a semi-colon (;) Proper use of white space. Commenting The engine will parse code line by line, stopping whenever it reaches a semi-colon. This is referred to as a statement termination, common to other programming languages such as C++, Javascript, etc. The following code will produce an error that may cause your entire script to fail: %testVariable = 3 %anotherVariable = 4; To the human eye, you are able to discern two separate lines of code with different actions. Here is how the script compiler will read it: %testVariable = 3%anotherVariable = 4; This is obviously not what the original code was meant to do. There are exemptions to this rule, but they come into play when multiple lines of code are supposed to work together for a single action: if(%testVariable == 4) echo(Variable equals 4); We have not covered conditional operators or echo commands yet, but you should notice that the first line does not have a semi-colon. The easiest explanation is that the code is telling the compiler: Read the first line, do the seco      ");

There are two very similar versions of this function: a global function version and an object method version. The base syntax for each is in Code Sample 1. //GLOBAL schedule(5000, spawnBadGuys, BadGuySpawner, 6, 3); //METHOD BadGuySpawner2.schedule(5000, spawnBadGuys, 6, 3); Code Sample 1 Both of the examples schedule a spawn bad guys event. Lets look at the global function version first. The first argument, 5000, is the number of milliseconds to delay the event for, so the bad guys will be spawned in 5 seconds. The second argument is the name of the function to be called. The third argument is the name of a reference object. If you specify an object in this argument, when the event is about to happen, Torque will check to make sure that object still exists. If the reference object does not exist at the scheduled time, the event will be skipped. If you do not want a reference object test, simply put 0 in this argument. All further arguments are passed to the scheduled function. In the fictitious example function, perhaps the 6 and 3 arguments represent the number of rows and columns of enemies to create. So, as long as the BadGuySpawner object exists in 5 seconds, this function call in Code Sample 2 will be executed at that time. spawnBadGuys( 6, 3); Code Sample 2 The object method version of schedule() is quite similar. The object that calls the schedule() method acts like the reference object in the global function. So, in the example, if BadGuySpawner2 does not exist at the scheduled time, the event is skipped. The other difference in the object method version, is that the specified function is called as a method of the object. So, after 5 seconds, the function call in Code Sample 3 will be executed. BadGuySpawner2.spawnBadGuys( 6, 3); Code Sample 3 If you ever need to cancel an event or check if an event is pending, they can be referenced using the eventID, which is returned when the sched      ");

Instead, the bracket notation is a shorthand for creating a variable name. a[0] is synonymous with a0, and M[1,4] with M1_4. You must not think of a as the name of the array containing a[5].

The language itself is derived from the scripting used for Tribes 2, which was the base tech Torque evolved from. Scripts are written and stored in .cs files, which are compiled and executed by a binary compiled via the C++ engine (.exe for Windows or .app OS X). The CS extension stands for C Script, meaning the language resembles C programming. Though there is a connection, TorqueScript is a much higher level language which is easier to learn than standard C or C++. Basic Usage Like most other scripting languages, such as Python or Java Script, TorqueScript is a high-level programming language interpreted by Torque 2D at run time. Unlike C++, you can write your code in script and run it without recompiling your game. All of your interfaces can be built using the GUI Editor, which saves the data out to TorqueScript. The same goes for data saved by the Level Builder or other editors in the engine. Most of the editors themselves are C++ components exposed and constructed via TorqueScript. More importantly, nearly all of your game play programming will be written in TorqueScript: inventory systems, win/lose scenarios, AI, weapon functionality, collision response, game flow. All of these can be written in TorqueScript. The language will allow you to rapidly prototype your game without having to be a programming expert or perform lengthy engine recompiling. Scripting vs Engine Programming The core C++ objects needed to make your game are exposed to TorqueScript through the script interpreter. For example, you will use the PlayerData structure to create player objects for your game. This structure was written in C++: C++ PlayerData Code struct PlayerData: public ShapeBaseData { typedef ShapeBaseData Parent; boo      ");

In this tutorial we will dynamically write a file through code and then read the contents of that file into our console. For more information about file IO in T2D, please refer to the T2D Reference document that comes with the engine. Writing a file To begin with, we are going to create a new .cs filecreate a new .cs file in our games/TutorialBase/game/gameScripts folder. Name this file FileIO.cs. We are creating this file using the TutorialBase project because it is a project that all Torque 2D users should have. The first thing we are going to do in our script file is create a simple function that will write a text document for us. At the top of our FileIO.cs file, add our first function: COLGROUP COL WIDTH=256 function writeFile() { %file = new FileObject(); if(%file.openForWrite(~/data/test.txt)) { %file.writeLine(Hello World!); echo(File Written); } else { error(File is not open for writing); } %file.close(); %file.delete(); } This function is pretty straightforward: it creates a new object (%file) of the type FileObject. There are standards for file locations introduced in Windows Vista and 7. If you need to modify files in the install directory, the user has to run your game in administrator mode, which is bad. Therefore, all data is put in the %APPDATA% directory (which varies in XP, Vista, and 7). You should use the same directory for a saved file and a loaded file as the system creates a replica of the folder structure you use when saving the file within your %APPDATA%/Independent folder in a sub-folder with your project name. From your point of view, it shouldnt matter. If you save to game/data/saveFile.sav, youll want to exec game/data/saveFile.sav. Simply be aware that the files you write wont be located where you would logically expect if you use this feature on Windows Vista or Windows 7. For more details, you can read t      ");

You probably want to put this line at the top of the startGame function - this way, your script changes will be recompiled each time you run the game. Brief Explanation of Exec: Because game logic should be spread across multiple script files (putting it all in one file would be a bad idea), TorqueScript needs a way to tell which scripts need to be prepared for your game. When the file is execd, it will be compiled into a .dso if needed and the files code will be ready for use with the rest of your game. As noted above, for changes to a script to show up in your game, they need to be execd. For this reason, exec statements are often put in the startGame function in game.cs. startGame is called by the Level Builder every time you hit play, so the scripts will be recompiled if needed. game.cs itself, however, is only recompiled when you open that project, so many people simply close T2D and reopen it (as many of the tutorials do).

There will be lots of stuff there - the console reports errors with the loading or running of T2D or your game. Press ~ again to close the console.

You will not be a TorqueScript master after simply reading this - that takes time and practice. But you will walk away with a good feel for how TorqueScript is structured and how it works. With this knowledge in hand, you will be ready to take off and start learning how to best use the tools TorqueScript gives you to create your game. What is Scripting? Scripting languages are programming languages designed to enable scripting. Scripting is the act of using preexisting (engine) components to accomplish new tasks. In other words, we use a scripting language to access features in the engine and then use those features to provide a game experience. Generally, scripting languages are interpreted, not compiled (like C++ and other languages). This makes scripting tasks somewhat slower than compiled tasks, but we make this trade in order to gain flexibility and visibility, as well as ease of use. Because scripting languages also allow you to modify your program without having to recompile it, we are able to rapidly prototype and repair code. This speeds development significantly. Often, scripting languages allow you to write code without worrying about nitty-gritty programming details like data types or memory management. This is both a boon and a bane. It is a boon in that it simplifies many programming tasks, but it is also a bane because it allows us to make mistakes that a strict compiled language and its compiler would find. T2D will catch and notify you of syntax errors, but it does not check for type mismatches or variable naming mistakes. TorqueScript TorqueScript is a very powerful, flexible language with syntax similar to C++. The following sections will describe all of its features and provide examples to demonstrate its usage.

All coordinate systems in T2D are two-dimensional. Canvas Space Canvas space matches the pixel size of the entire T2D window. (0, 0) is the upper left hand corner of the window and (resX, resY) is the lower right hand corner, where resX and resY are the horizontal and vertical resolution. Coordinates in this space are integer values. Conversions Window space can be converted to canvas space with the t2dSceneWindow::getCanvasPoint() function. Local Space: Object Space Each object has its own local coordinate system in object space. Valid coordinates in this system are in the range [-1.0, 1.0] where the point (-1.0, -1.0) is the upper left corner of the objects bounding box and (1.0, 1.0) is the lower right corner of the bounding box. The center of the object is the origin. This space is used to define various t2dSceneObject properties such as the collision polygon and mount points. Conversions Object space can be converted to world space with the t2dSceneObject::getWorldPoint() function. World space can be converted to object space with the t2dSceneObject::getLocalPoint() function. Window Space Window space is simply a translation of canvas space offset by the position of the t2dSceneWindow on the GuiCanvas.

World space can be converted to window space with the t2dSceneWindow::getWindowPoint() function. Window space can be converted to world space with the t2dSceneWindow::getWorldPoint() function. Scene Space: World Space World space is a virtual coordinate system that defines positions in the game world. By default, the origin is in the center of the screen, however this can be changed through the t2dSceneWindow camera methods. The coordinate system is independent of screen resolution.

These are the “effect” (t2dParticleEffect) and the “emitter” (t2dParticleEmitter). An emitter is an object that actual emits particles in a configurable manner. An unlimited quantity of emitters can be created within an effect. An effect is essentially a container of emitters. Emitters cannot ‘see’ each other and therefore cannot alter each others properties. An effect can alter emitters’ properties by scaling them as a group. As a practical example, let’s assume we want to create a fire-effect. We want the effect to have three components: smoke, flames and sparks. The good thing is that the effect allows you to create these three separate components and keep them all together, handling them as a single object but still allowing individual emitters to be configured. We can go ahead and create three emitters, each of which generate a component of the fire-effect: smoke, flames and sparks. If we want to tweak an aspect of the smoke, we can go into the effect and look at the smoke-emitter we created and tweak its configuration. What if we want to increase the particle-sizes for all emitters in the effect, not just a single one; how do we do this? It’s actually really easy! We can do this because almost every configurable parameter in an emitter is duplicated in the container effect. How does this help us? Quite simply, the effect parameters scale all emitter parameters contained within it. This means that if we set the particle-size to x2, all particles in all the emitters become twice the size. This is a means to make effect-wide changes instantly. As a note: not all parameters in the effect scale the emitters. The effect can directly control other emission properties if the respective emitters allow this. See below for more details. The hierarchy for the fire-effect described above is shown below:- particle-engine hierarchy Fields An effect or an emitter can be controlled via its fiel      ");

One of the big hurdles when developing any product is managing resources and there are few types of resources more troublesome than images. Not only do images occupy lots of disk space and memory but they are typically numerous. Add to this that there are performance issues related to the way images are stored/accessed and that these images have various runtime options associated with them and the situation can get quite complex. Heres where T2D provides a helping hand; introducing the t2dImageMapDatablock. As the name implies, the t2dImageMapDatablock is a type of datablock hereto referred to as an Image-Map. The first question here is naturally, what is a datablock? and although a full discussion of the capabilities of datablocks is beyond this document, its worth providing a very quick overview. Datablocks are specialized objects that provide a portable/reusable container for common and typically-static data. Data here could refer to characteristics of an enemys movement, the look/feel of GUI elements or more importantly for this document, definition of your imagery. An example of a datablock would be one that defines the properties of an enemy so that whenever an enemy is created, it takes its start-up properties from the datablock. By changing the datablock definition, you can globally change the behavior of your enemies. Typically, datablocks do not change at runtime but there is absolutely nothing to stop you doing this. Some things can be changed dynamically, some cant. The great thing about datablocks is that they have their own keyword within the Torque-Script language call datablock in the same sense that a function has, err &hellip; well, function but well get into the details of configuring datablocks shortly.

As an introductory feature, the AStar implementation provides the key capabilities needed for many styles of games that benefit from dynamic path finding. The initial implementation was based off the excellent work performed by Phil Shenk, as first released in his T2D resource A-Star Pathfinding Extension for T2D. Some of the features have been streamlined and reconfigured for binary only users, and a few capabilities added or adjusted in this release, providing additional flexibility. Many Thanks to Phil for his outstanding work! A-Star Concepts A-Star Path Finding is a common computer AI requirement that allows developers to create a set of data within their game world to enable agents to navigate within the world in a (relatively) smart manner. It is based on a powerful and flexible algorithm designed around the concept of a grid that contains values indicating how much effort it requires to navigate across a grid square, allowing objects to make decisions about what path to take to reach a destination. A-Star calculations are relatively expensive compared to other aspects of a game engine, and its important to realize from the beginning that they dont have unlimited power-the size of a grid, and therefore the total number of navigation points within the grid, directly impacts the time it takes to calculate an A-Star path. Careful selection of a navigation grid size is very important for every game and is dependent on a number of factors, so it is important to realize that you can only go so far with ho      ");

Hine. First Id like to acknowledge the person who wrote the aStar code. This is an awesome resource. Thanks Phil. After trying to implement this in a few games I finally figured it out. Here is the easiest way to use aStar. Step 1: (Creating a Project) First create a new project called aStarFollowing, add the puzzle template, and check the copy executable box. Next we will need to add some behaviors to make the player and camera move. (You can get the behaviors from the Shooter game demo included with Torque 2D.) Simply copy the behaviors from the Shootergamebehaviors folder into the aStarFollowinggamebehaviors folder. The next step to do is to reload T2Ds editor. This can be done by going to the project menu and clicking reload project. This will add the new behaviors to the editor. Now the aStar files need to be added to the scripts folder. They should be in T2Ds installed folder: Program FilesTorqueTorqueGameBuilder-1.7.5gamesAStarDemogamegameScripts. Copy the files aStarActor.cs and aStarPath.cs into the aStarFollowinggamegameScripts folder. All files are setup except the scripts we need to create. The next section will set up the scene for interaction with the player and AI. Step 2: (Creating a scene) aStar uses a tile map to process path calculations. Each tile in the map is a location in the game world that the AI can either be on or have to move around. This is set up is by using the tile editor to create values for each tile in the map. First drag a new newlayer object into the level area from the tile maps tab. Change the tile count x/y to 30 and tile size x/y to 5. Then press the size object to layer button to show all the tiles. To add tiles to the map press the tile editing tab to reveal the edit controls: First, under image find the puzzleBlock_1ImageMap. Then under custom data delete none and type in 10. This is where aStar will find the value to rate each tile. Each tile in the ma      ");

Development paths allow publishing to Windows and Mac. And with its intuitive and powerful editor, anyone can jump into game creation with little to no prior knowledge. Using a game engine is not just a shortcut to finishing a game.

However, you must also realize that there is a lot of power under the hood that should be harnessed. The Engine The engine, also referred to as the source code, was developed entirely in C++ and Objective C. The most important thing to realize about Torque 2D is that it is a large, complex system. Having source code access allows you to extend the engine to be whatever you want and optimize game play code using a native language. For instance, if you wish to add in MYSQL functionality or integrate Box2D, the path is not closed to you. Another benefit of having source code access is the ability to read through the comments and structures to gain a better understanding of how the script system is set up. Do not be intimidated. If you wish to start working with the engine, you can do so whenever you feel comfortable. These docs will not force you into the engine. TorqueScript TorqueScript is a very powerful, flexible language with syntax similar to C++. The benefit of writing script code is that you do not have to recompile your executable, which means you do not have to dive into the source code. Simply create or modify a script, save it, then run the game to see the effects. You MUST restart your game in order to see the script changes. To utilize TorqueScript you do not need to be a code guru or know the nit      ");

In this tutorial we are going to cover how to change your design resolution, how to change your camera view, and how changing your workspace in these ways will affect your project. This tutorial will be using the stock TutorialBase project file that comes with the engine. To open that file, launch T2D and click Open Project. If you are already editing a project, click on File-&gt;Open Project... Once the file browser is open, navigate to the games/TutorialBase folder. Select the project.t2dProj file to begin. Camera View and Design Resolution Your camera view is defined in T2D as a box with a thick border around it. The color is based on your Scene Editor grid color preferences (Edit-&gt;Preferences, Scene Editor tab). Though games can take up much more space than this square, all that will be visible to the end-user is what is inside of this square at any given moment (as shown in Figure 1): Figure 1 To begin, lets start by dragging in one of the graphics from the Static Sprites library. I chose to drag in the GarageGames logo (as shown in Figure 2). As you can see, once I drop the graphic in my scene, it is automatically resized in the view. This is because of the design resolution. The design resolution is the size that T2D is going to assume your camera view is. When it resizes graphics, it is going to resize them relative to what the design resolution currently is. By default, the design resolution is set to 800 x 600 - therefore all graphics that are dragged into the scene will be sized properly relative to the camera view. Figure 2 To access your design resolution, go up to the Edit Menu and choose Preferences (as shown in Figure 3): Figure 3 Once you click Preferences, you should be confronted by a dialog that contains all of your preference settings.

The main use of the T2D Tile Map Builder is to make the map of your game world. Any 2D game that happens in some sort of a world will use a map of some kind, whether it is a top-down map (e.g. Frogger), side-view map (e.g. Mario Bros.), or something more complicated like a 3/4 view map (e.g. Double Dragon). In almost every case, the map used for a 2D game will have repeating elements. Using the examples above, here are screenshots with some repeating elements outlined in yellow: Figure 1 Using a tilemap to create repeating elements has many advantages. One of the most important of these is that memory is used more efficiently... rather than having to load a large graphics file with your whole map in it, your game refers to a few small files that are repeated. This decreases overall file size for your game as well, which means faster download time for online games. Another advantage is the ease of level construction. When you use a tilemap system, you have a level construction set that makes initial construction and changes very quick and simple. Setting up for this Tutorial A good, standard practice for T2D when starting something new is to create a new project. Load up the Level Builder and click on File...New Project (figure 2).

Another term well be using a lot in this tutorial is image map, which refers to an image file. As far as file types go, Torque can use .jpg (or .jpeg) and .png image maps. To prepare for this tutorial, run Torque 2D and create a new project by choosing New Project... from the file menu. Name the new project Sprites and use the Empty Game project template.

One feature is the ability to create an art resource. An art resource is basically a group of images, usually of similar theme, that are already set up in T2D for easy import. This includes both static and animated sprites. Resources are good for many reasons. First and foremost, they are very easy to import into a T2D project. Instead of individually importing images, the entire package is imported, properly set up, and named in just a few clicks . Secondly, since resources are not owned by any one project and are (ideally) modularized by theme, they become lego-like pieces that can be shared between many game projects easily. Finally, since it is not exclusive to any project, it allows developers to avoid having duplicate images in more than one project. In this tutorial we are going to look at the process of creating and importing a resource. Getting Started To begin with we need to open up T2D. When T2D loads, go to FILE -&gt; Open Project and find the project named games/TutorialBase/project.t2dproj (as shown in Figure 1). *Note: if you already have that project open, you will not see it in the open dialog. COLGROUP COL WIDTH=203 COL WIDTH=446 Figure 1 Once your project is open, you should see the create tab at the right filled with many different static and animated sprites. Now, though everything is already imported into this project, what if you wanted to use this art in a different project? You would have to copy the images into the new projects image folder and then individually import each graphic into the project, setting up its name and modes. However, thanks to our ability to create art resources in T2D, our lives are much simpler than that. We are going to turn the art in the TutorialBase project into a resource. First, we need to create a place for our art resource in the place where all of the other resources are. Navigate       ");

A path is a series of points called nodes that are connected together by various means. The Scene Editor provides a tool with which paths can be created and edited, and objects can be attached. The path object in T2D (t2dPath) is a scene object itself, so it can do things like have velocities applied, react to physics, and even attach to another path. For this tutorial, we will be using the Torque 2D project called TutorialBase. Run Torque 2D. If the project is not already loaded, select Open Project from the File menu, then select TutorialBase/project.t2proj from the list and press OK. Also, if you had previously created a level with this project it will be loaded. In this case, select New Scene from the File menu. Creating a Path Select the create tab in the side panel, scroll down to the Other rollout, and click and drag the GarageGames logo labeled Path into your scene. Visibly, it wont seem like much happened, but what you just did was activate the path tool. The path tool allows you to create, move, and delete path nodes. To create a node, simply click somewhere in the scene. To move any of these nodes, you can click on them and drag the mouse. To delete a node, right click on it. You will notice that the path nodes follow the snap settings of the editor just like sizing and moving object. To turn off grid snapping, click on Edit-&gt;Preferences... in the menu. In the Scene Editor tab, uncheck Snap to X Axis and Snap to Y Axis. Create a path with four nodes. When you have finished, press Enter on the keyboard or click on the arrow (labeled Selection Tool) in the toolbar.

With practice, youll be able to use the T2D particle builder to create some really amazing visual effects. To be exact, a particle effect is a group of similar graphics that combine to make an interesting visual effect. Particle effects are generated automatically by a set of parameters that can be edited in Torque 2D. They also move automatically according to a similar set of parameters. One example of a particle effect is a cloud of smoke that is made of a bunch of small smoke-puff graphics that move around in a cluster. Another example would be rain, which might be made of a bunch of raindrops that move from the top of the screen to the bottom. Preparation To prepare for this tutorial, you need to have additional particles and assets currently not in the T2D install. Next, run Torque 2D and load the TutorialBase project (if its not already loaded) by choosing Open Project... from the file menu and selecting games/TutorialBase/project.t2dProj.

Thanks to config datablocks and behaviors, the setting up of multiple similar or identical objects is very simple. Config datablocks are basically saved sets of parameters that you can apply to any object in the Level Builder. They are handy because when creating a great deal of identical objects, you only need to write their parameters once and then reference those parameters (via a config datablock) as many times as you need. This tutorial is going to go through the creation of a config datablock and show you how they can be used to make repetitive tasks much less time-consuming. Creating a Config Datablock The first thing we are going to do is create a config datablock and then later access it using the Level Builder. We are going to create this config datablock in our TutorialBase project, since it is a default project all T2D owners will have access to. So, our first step is to navigate to our games/TutorialBase/game/gameScripts folder. In this folder we have a file called datablocks.cs. This file will contain our config datablock. Config datablocks can be created in any part of our code, however datablocks created in this script will automatically be loaded saving you the trouble of creating a separate file that has to be manually executed. Inside this file we are going to create a very simple config datablock that is just going to show you how they work.

In this tutorial we will show you how to create your own sound descriptions and profiles, load your sound into your game, and show you some of the ways you can manipulate sound in T2D. For more reference on this subject, please refer to the T2D Reference document that is provided with Torque 2D. Setting Up Our Sound Files Our first order of business is to get some sound files to mess around with. In your games/Reactor/game/data/audio folder you will see a sound file used in the demo: BLIP.WAV. For the purposes of our tutorial, we are going to grab it. Copy this file and paste them into your games/TutorialBase/game/data/audio folder. As you might have guessed, we are going to use our TutorialBase project to test our sound in. In order for sounds to be accessed by T2D, they must have an audio description and an audio profile. An audio description sets the properties of the sound and the profile sets the name of the sound, the description to use, and the actual audio file to be referenced. For this tutorial, we are going to create two audio descriptions, one for looping sound and one for non-looping sound. Navigate to your games/TutorialBase/game/gameScripts folder and create a new .cs file named audioDatablocks.cs. Audio descriptions and profiles can be accessed anywhere in script; however, for the sake of organization, we are creating our audio code in a separate file.

The default is four equally-sized frames, which is correct for this image, so press Save. Now its time to adjust the FlourSack image. Double click on the FlourSack imageMap. Choose CELL image mode. The frames dont look quite right, so were going to adjust the cell sizes. For starters, change the Cell Width to 85 and press Enter. That looks like the right width. Lets assume that the cells are as tall as they are wide and change the Cell Height to 85 also. The result does not look perfect. Enter 112 instead (as shown in Figure 4). It should look a lot better.

MOLE_LEVEL::timePerGame = 30; // seconds function moleLevel::onLevelLoaded(%this) { %this.respawnPointSet = new SimSet(); // set the occupied counter to zero %this.spawnPointsOccupied = 0; %this.maxCreationInterval = MOLE_FACTORY::maxCreationInterval; %this.minCreationInterval = MOLE_FACTORY::minCr      ");

To avoid this the moleLevel::spawnMole() function has to be modified in the moleLevel.cs script file. It first looks for any respawnPoints free. If so, it continues and randomly picks a respawnPoint until it finds one that is not occupied. It spawns the mole as before and then marks the spawn point as occupied. function moleLevel::spawnMole(%this) { // if all spawn points are occupied dont spawn a new mole if( %this.spawnPointsOccupied == %this.respawnPointSet.getCount() ) return; // find a respawn point %pointFound = false; // search until we find a respawn point while ( !%pointFound ) { %respawnPointIndex = getRandom( %this.respawnPointSet.getCount()-1 ); %respawnPoint = %this.respawnPointSet.getObject( %respawnPointIndex ); if( %respawnPoint.isOccupied = ) %pointFound = true; } // select a color for the mole %color = getRandom(2); if( %color == 0 ) %color = Red; if( %color == 1 ) %color = Green; if( %color == 2 ) %color = Lilac; // create a new Mole %mole = new t2dAnimatedSprite() { sceneGraph = %this; class = Mole; layer = 4; size = 9.125 16; }; // play the right animation according to the color %mole.playAnimation(animMoleComeOut @ %color); // save the selected color as dynamic field %mole.moleColor = %color; // set the position of the mole to the position of the respawn point %mole.setPosition( %respawnPoint.getPosition() ); // mark this respawn point as occupied %respawnPoint.isOccupied = true; // increment the occupied counter %this.spawnPointsOccupied += 1; // give the mole a reference to its respawn point %mole.respawnPoint = %respawnPoint; } Code Sample 3.1 We also have to mark the respawn points as free again when a mole gets whacked (in the mole.cs), function mole::onAnimationEnd(%this) { if(%this.getAnimationName() != (animMoleComeOut @ %this.moleColor)) { // free the respawn point for other moles %t      ");

We do not want the mole to respawn at the same position it was when you whacked it but we do not want it to respawn at a completely random position either. So the first thing we will do is add some respawn points to our level. We will simply use static sprites as our respawn points. We will be using the hole image, that you should see listed in your Static Sprites object library in the Create tab (as shown in Figure 2.1). Figure 2.1 We will again use the class field to assign the class respawnPoint to our respawn points. But as we will probably have several respawn points per level, it would be a bit tedious to type respawnPoint over and over again. Fortunately with T2D we have an object called config datablocks that can store data that will be repeated across multiple objects. So we will use a config datablock to make our life easier. First, we will create a file for later. Add the bold text to your startGame() function in game.cs: function startGame(%level) { //exec game scripts exec(./mole.cs); exec(./respawnPoint.cs); // Set The GUI. Canvas.setContent(mainScreenGui); Canvas.setCursor(DefaultCursor); moveMap.push(); // this has been added: sceneWindow2D.setUseObjectMouseEvents( true ); if( isFile( %level ) || isFile( %level @ .dso)) sceneWindow2D.loadLevel(%level); } Code Sample 2.1 Now look in your gameScripts folder. You should find datablocks.cs. Open this file and add these lines of code: datablock t2dSceneObjectDatablock( respawnPointDatablock ) { class = respawnPoint; // the class that will be associated with the object layer = 5; // the render layer size = 16 16; // the size of the object }; This is the file where you create all of your datablocks. Now that it has the respawnPoint datablock, lets fire up T2D and add it to our mole hills. Code Sample 2.2 COLGROUP COL WIDTH=242 COL WIDTH=407 Figure 2.2 Now af      ");

The tutorial consists of five parts in which we will gradually create a playable game from the ground up. First things first - Creating a New Project Our first step is to create a new project in Torque 2D called “WackAMole”.

Now your object library should be populated with all of the mole art (as shown in Figure 1.4). Figure 1.4 Putting our mole on the screen Now we will put the mole on the screen. This is rather easy. Go to the right panel and select the CREATE tab. Next, go down to the Animated Sprites rollout and drag and drop the three mole sprites with heads above-ground into the center of your level (as shown in Figure 1.5). Figure 1.5 You can test the game going to Project &gt; Run Game. You will probably be told that you have to save the level before you can test it. Save it as level1.t2d in WhackAMole/data/levels/. When you finally test your game, you should see the moles sitting there doing nothing. In the next part of the tutorial, we will change that. Making our mole disappear Next we need to make the mole disappear when it is clicked on. To accomplish this we will need some scripting. Close T2D and create a new file called mole.cs in WhackAMole/gameScripts/ and open it in your favorite script editor. Lets first write the function mole::onAdd(). This function will be called automatically when a new mole is created. We use onAdd() here in      ");

Making it Pretty 7.1 Blazing Trails At this point, as far as functionality goes, this game is complete. However, since T2D has a really powerful particle system, it would be a shame to let it go to waste. So, this final section deals with adding particle effects to our game and making things look pretty! First, go into the create tab of the Level Builder and find the Particle Effects rollout (as shown in Figure 7.1.1). Figure 7.1.1 The really neat thing about the particle effects rollout is that you can preview the effect simply by hovering your mouse over it (as shown in Figure 7.1.2). For our purposes however, we are interested in only two effects. Click and drag the particle effect that looks like a line of fire shooting to the left into the vicinity of your ship. Figure 7.1.2 Once you have that effect dragged out, you will probably notice something that you dont like - as with much of what we have dragged into out level, it is not sized the way we would want (as shown in Figure 7.1.3). Figure 7.1.3 In fact, the particle effect is so small, you have to zoom way in to even see it. Thankfully this is an easy fix. To fix this, we need to select our particle effect and go into the edit tab. Once you click on the edit tab, you will immediately notice something that you havent seen before. Do not panic, this strange thing is the particle builder (as shown in Figure 7.1.4). Figure 7.1.4 Inside the particle builder, you can adjust everything about your particles. For now however, we are only interested in one thing - making the particles big enough to look good on our ship.In the particle builder, click the emitters name to open the emitter panel and then click Edit Emitter Graph (as shown in Figure 7.1.5). Figure 7.1.5 When you open the graph view of the particle builder, you should see a graph for the field that is currently being edited. Below the graph you should see a min and max setting, and a time setting.      ");

After all, you are invincible, there is nothing that can hurt you...yet. This section deals with adding collision to the player and giving the enemies weapons. First, lets enable the player to collide with the other objects in the scene. You will do this very similarly to how you gave your enemies collision. Draw a collision polygon around the player ship that roughly outlines it. You might be tempted to follow its contours exactly, but thats not necessary (or possible - because the ship is concave). Figure 6.1.2b Now that you have your collision polygon created, we need to set its parameters in the Collision rollout of the edit tab. You should set its collision parameters to mirror those you set for the enemy (as shown in Figure 6.1.3). Figure 6.1.3b Once you have your collision set, click on your enemy ship and go into their dynamic fields rollout of the edit tab. Once there you should give them a variable of missileSpeed and set its value to whatever you want, I set mine to -500 (as shown in Figure 6.1.4). Figure 6.1.4 When you have your enemys dynamic fields set up – it is time to code once again. Save your progress and close out of the editor. After you have closed out T2D, browse out to your yourProjectName/gameScripts folder and open your enemy.cs file. At the bottom of the file, add this function: function enemyShip::fireMissile(%this) { %this.enemyMissile = new t2dStaticSprite() { scenegraph = %this.scenegraph; class = enemyMissile; missileSpeed = %this.missileSpeed; enemy = %this; }; %this.enemyMissile.fire(); } Code Sample 6.1.1 This function is almost exactly the same as the one we put on our player in the last section.

Adding Combat 5.1 Making Missiles First we will need to get the player shooting at the enemy. To do this requires quite a bit of scripting – so first we need to give our player another dynamic field. Go into the playerShips dynamic field rollout and add a variable missileSpeed – I set my value to 1000 (as shown in Figure 5.1.1). Figure 5.1.1 This field will define how fast our missile goes when we fire it. Now that you have your field set up, it is time to start scripting! Save your progress and close out T2D. Once you have T2D closed out, browse out to yourProjectName/gameScripts folder and open up your player.cs file. When you have your player.cs file open, add this to your onLevelLoaded function with all of your other keybind functions: moveMap.bindCmd(keyboard, space, pShip.createMissile();, ); Code Sample 5.1.1 This simply binds your space key to the global function createMissile. As you can see, we had to specify which object would be using the createMissile function – our players ship. Now that we have the space bar calling the createMissile function, lets create that function. Place this code at the bottom of your player.cs file: function playerShip::createMissile(%this) { %this.playerMissile = new t2dStaticSprite() { scenegraph = %this.scenegraph; class = playerMissile; missileSpeed=%this.missileSpeed; player = %this; }; %this.playerMissile.fire(); } Code Sample 5.1.2 This line of code creates our missile, and sets class and speed. Also, it creates fields that store the scenegraph and player. These will be used later on when our missile fires. After it creates the missile, it calls the fire function for the playerMissile class that we havent created yet. This code is all that we need to add to the player.cs file, however, now we need to create a new file for the players missile.

Making Conflict 4.1 Creating Enemies So, now that we have our player in the level and moving around, bound by the constraints of the map, lets give him an opponent to worry about. In your Static Sprites library in your Create tab, click and drag an enemy ship into the level. You will notice something peculiar when you drag your enemy into the scene: Your enemy is HUGE compared to you! The reason he is so much bigger is not because he was drawn bigger, it is because when T2D resizes artwork, they resize it in respect to your camera view. This is a good idea because if you made all of your artwork for an 800x600 game, T2D will size it for you in ratio to your canvas. That simply means that T2D assumes that the camera view is an 800x600 screen view and so sizes the artwork we bring in relative to that assumption. So, since we made our camera view bigger to accommodate our player ship, all other art we bring in is going to be bigger (as shown in Figure 4.1.1.). So, to remedy this, we need to resize our enemy to about the size of our player (as shown in Figure 4.1.2). Figure 4.1.1 Figure 4.1.2 Now that we have our enemy, lets get them moving across the screen. Like the player ship, we will need to give this enemy a name and a class. Go into the Edit tab with the enemy selected and type in the name “eShip” and a class of “enemyShip”. Again we should save our progress and close down T2D. Browse out to your yourProjectName/gameScripts folder, the same folder we created our player.cs file, add a new text file named enemy.cs Inside your enemy.cs file, add the following code: function enemyShip::onLevelLoaded(%this, %scenegraph) { %this.enemyMovement(); } function enemyShip::enemyMovement(%this) { %this.setLinearVelocityX(getRandom(%this.minSpeed, %this.maxSpeed)); } Code Sample 4.1.1 All this function does is call a movement function for the enemy that sets its speed along the X axis to a random variable between minSpeed and maxSpeed.

Adding Player Input 3.1 Class Setup Good, we now have our sky set up, as well as our players ship in the level. However, there isnt anything for a player to do in the game so far. This section of the tutorial deals with adding player input into the game. First, we will give the players ship the ability to move around the game world. To refer to our ship in code, we need to give it a name and a class. To do that, we need to select our ship and go into the Edit tab. Once we are in our edit tab we need to collapse the Scene Object rollout and expand the Scripting rollout (as shown in Figure 3.1.1). Figure 3.1.1 You will notice that there are only six options in this rollout. For right now, we are only going to use the first two: Name and Class. The name of an object is what you will call it when you program in Torque Script. The class is basically the group your object belongs to. Every object with the same class will be able to do the same things. So, in the Name and Class options, you will need to type in a name for your ship and a class for your ship. If you are unfamiliar with programming, I suggest that you name your ship and class the same as myself so that the code we will be using later wont have to be changed to fit your ship. For my project, I named my ship pShip and my class playerShip (as shown in Figure 3.1.2). Figure 3.1.2 Now that you have set up your ship to have a name and a class, you can direct what your ship can do with code. To start with, we are going to give our player the ability to move their ship around the screen. To do that, we need to save our level, exit out, and do a little coding in a text editor or equivalent program. Before we exit we want to make sure we save out our level properly, so that when we load up T2D again we have our ship already placed and with its class already set. Save your level with whatever name you want. Once you have your level saved correctly, you      ");

Setting up the Level 2.1 Camera Setup First, to set up our level, we should make sure that the game world is big enough. To do this, simply click and hold on the picture of your players ship and drag it into the scene view. The blue outline in the scene view is the camera view – basically the view that the player will have of the game world at any one time. When you create game levels in T2D, you can create a level that is much larger than this camera view. However, only what is inside this camera view will be shown at any time. You should notice once you place your ship inside the camera view, that it takes up a good deal of space in the view. Since this is a side-scrolling shooter, the player should have a good view of whats ahead of them so they can prepare appropriately. As it stands, the camera view is much too small for that to happen (as shown in Figure 2.1.1). Note: You can right click and drag to move your workspace around, you can also zoom in via a mouse scroll or click on the View drop down menu and choose a zoom option. The camera view is too small Figure 2.1.1 Thankfully, the T2D Level Builder has an awesome tool that will allow us to easily resize the camera view to fit our needs! First, click on the Camera Tool (as shown in Figure 2.1.2): Figure 2.1.2 Once you have clicked on the camera tool, your view should zoom out and you should see your camera view with resize handles on it (the blue boxes around the outside perimeter of the square). We want to keep the same aspect ratio as default – so we will choose the resize handle on the top-right corner of the camera view and stretch it out while holding CTRL on the keyboard – this should keep the view the same shape as it was originally (as shown in Figure 2.1.3 and Figure 2.1.4). Figure 2.1.4 Figure 2.1.3 Once you have resized the camera view to a size you are satisfied with, click the Selection Tool next to the Camera Tool to save your changes (as shown in Figure 2.1.5).

So please remember to stop by the T2D Private Forums and come talk with other T2D developers, get help, and much more. Also, keep an eye on the Torque 2D Product Page for updates. Okay, let’s get on with this tutorial. Were going to walk you through a quick example of how to use T2D. By the end of this shooter tutorial, you’ll have learned how to load sprites and particle effects, set up collision detection, accept player input, and even add a hint of gameplay! We’ll treat T2D pretty much as a black box - rather than explaining how everything works inside T2D, our goal here is just to get you up and running as quickly as possible. This tutorial is written so that pretty much anyone can understand it; experienced programmers will no doubt want to skip over some of the explanatory stuff. We’re not trying to provide a whole programming tutorial; We assume you are at least capable of reading and understanding simple scripts. If you want more information on TorqueScript, please see the Torque Documentation in the documentation/reference/ folder. We’ll be adding to the T2D documentation more and more over time. Be sure to regularly check back and watch for new T2D documentation. Alright, let’s see how to get some stuff up on the screen! 1.

Setting up the Project To start, open up T2D (by clicking the T2D icon on your desktop). By default, the Level Builder will start with the last project that was loaded. This makes it really easy to pick up where you left off. If you have been playing around with the Level Builder before reading this you will see whatever you worked on last.

Save the level as level1.t2d(figure 1.4). Figure 1.4 Importing Art Its time to start adding the content we will use in our platformer.

Adding Mines 7.1 A new obstacle Now our fish game has bubbles we need to eat, and fish that try to eat it before us, as well as the need to eat the bubbles in time to survive. Its missing one thing though, exploding fish! That is why we need mines, to add a true peril as well as exploding fish. We already have an image that will work as our mine in our multi-frame fish image. So we will need to create a new class for this mine. Our mine will react a bit differently than any of our other objects. We dont want it to just sit there, since that doesnt make that great of an obstacle. We also dont want it to just drop like our bubbles do, that just doesnt seem to fit a mine quite so well (plus it makes it a bit too predictable). So, what we will do is drop the mine from the top of the screen, and calculate a random center position (well give it a proper range of our levels height). Then it will float up and down around that position. That should provide an interesting enough obstacle! On top of that if the player fish touches it, it will go off and decrease the players life substantially. Thus we have exploding fish! 7.2 Creating our base mine script Our first step will be to browse out to MyFishGame/gameScripts and to add a mine.cs script file. Now that we have the script file, we need to be sure to exec it, so open up your game.cs script file and modify your startGame() function to look like this. function startGame(%level) { exec(./player.cs); exec(./fishfood.cs); exec(./fish.cs); exec(./mine.cs); Canvas.setContent(mainScreenGui); Canvas.setCursor(DefaultCursor); new ActionMap(moveMap); moveMap.push(); enableDirectInput = true; activateDirectInput(); enableJoystick(); sceneWindow2D.loadLevel(%level); } Code Sample 7.2.1 Now lets open our mine.cs and add our first function.

Adding More Gameplay 6.1 Other fish Ok now that we have our basic game play implemented, we can add a few more aspects to it. Right now, the goal of the fish is to gather the food. So what we can do, is add in another fish that swims by at random locations, and picks up the food instead of our fish. This means we will create a new class for this new type of fish, though we dont have to worry about any input aspects. These new fish will simply swim from one side of the level to the other. Once off screen we can move them to a random Y location and then make them swim back. Our first step is to create the scripts that will control the movement of the fish. So browse to the MyFishGame/gameScripts folder and create a new script file called fish.cs. Also remember that since we have added a new script file, we need to make sure it gets included when T2D runs. Open up your game.cs script file so we can add a new exec() command. We need to add another exec statement to our startGame() function. component name=Scripting/Executing Scripts[How to Exec Scripts] Make your startGame() function look like this. function startGame(%level) { exec(./player.cs); exec(./fishfood.cs); exec(./fish.cs); Canvas.setContent(mainScreenGui); Canvas.setCursor(DefaultCursor); new ActionMap(moveMap); moveMap.push(); enableDirectInput = true; activateDirectInput(); enableJoystick(); sceneWindow2D.loadLevel(%level); } Code Sample 6.1.1 Now our new fish.cs script will be included when we run T2D. Open it up, and before we add our onLevelLoaded() function for our new fish, lets add a couple of helper functions. This fish class will act a bit differently than our FishPlayer class. Since we arent controlling it, we just want it to go from the left side to the right side. This can be handled in the onWorldLimit callback, just like our bubble.

Adding Game Play 5.1 Falling food We are at a good stage to implement some basic game play aspects. First, we will add falling food to the level, so we can move our fish to gather the food. Later we can add obstacles, but first we need to get the food spawning and gathering working. Browse out to your MyFishGame/gameScripts folder. This time we arent going to open player.cs yet; we are going to create a new script file. Create a new text file and name it fishfood.cs. Now that we have created the script file, we need to make sure it gets included when we run T2D. We did this with player.cs. It works the same here. Open up game.cs in the same gameScripts folder. You should see a function called startGame(). If you remember, we added the exec(./player.cs); script line. We now need to add another one for our fishfood.cs. So make the function look like this. function startGame(%level) { exec(./player.cs); exec(./fishfood.cs); Canvas.setContent(mainScreenGui); Canvas.setCursor(DefaultCursor); new ActionMap(moveMap); moveMap.push(); enableDirectInput = true; activateDirectInput(); enableJoystick(); sceneWindow2D.loadLevel(%level); } Code Sample 5.1.1 Be sure to save the game.cs script file, and then you can close it. Now that the fishfood.cs script will be executed, lets flesh it out. Lets script a new class to handle our fish food. Start by adding this onLevelLoaded function. function FishFood::onLevelLoaded(%this, %scenegraph) { %this.startPosition = %this.getPosition(); %this.setLinearVelocityY(getRandom(%this.minSpeed, %this.maxSpeed)); } Code Sample 5.1.2 This onLevelLoaded function is actually pretty simple. We just store the start position on the object and then set its linear velocity in the Y direction. We get a random number between its minSpeed and maxSpeed. We will need to specify those as Dynamic Fields in the Level Builder. Add this next function to your fishfood.cs. function FishFood::onWorldLimit(%this, %mode, %limit) { i      ");

Adjusting Movement 4.1 Making our fish face the proper direction One of the initial problems you have probably noticed, is that when we move our fish left and right it still faces the same direction. Fixing this is quite simple, and will require only a couple of lines of script. Browse out to your MyFishGame/gameScripts folder to find the player.cs script we created in part 2. Open player.cs in any unformatted text editor or your favorite Script Editor (Notepad or TextEdit works just fine). We want to alter the facing of the fish object when we move left and right. Start by locating the fishPlayerLeft() function. It should look like this. function fishPlayerLeft() { FishPlayer.setLinearVelocityX( -30 ); } Code Sample 4.1.1 To handle issues like this, T2D has a nice set of methods called setFlip. These methods flip the image in either the X and/or Y direction by passing it either a true or false value. If you pass it false, then it disables the flip and restores the image to its default direction. If you pass it true, then it flips the image in whichever direction you specify (by calling setFlipX(true/false) or setFlipY(true/false)). When we move right we want the fish to be facing its default direction, so we can call the flip function with false to ensure it is flipped back to its default direction. Replace the fishPlayerLeft() function with this. function fishPlayerLeft() { FishPlayer.setFlipX(true); FishPlayer.setLinearVelocityX( -30 ); } Code Sample 4.1.2 As you can see, we set its flipX to true, so that it will face the flipped direction of left when we move left. This means that we need to add a setFlipX(false) to the function called when we move right. So replace your fishPlayerRight() function with this. function fishPlayerRight() { FishPlayer.setFlipX(false); FishPlayer.setLinearVelocityX( 30 ); } Code Sample 4.1.3 Now, when we move left or right our fish should be facing the appropriate direction. Be sure to save your scr      ");

Creating the Level 3.1 Add our background image Now that we have our fish moving on key press, we can give it a level to move around in. We have three background images that we can place. First we will place the one first on the Static Sprites list (as shown in Figure 3.1.1), so click and drag it into your level. Figure 3.1.1 As you can see, after dropping the image into your level it is far too big. This is because the images source size was created very big to scale properly with higher resolutions. So lets scale it down. The easiest way to do this is to zoom out (with your mouse wheel or the zoom out button) and then grab a corner, hold shift as you drag to keep its ratio, our goal is to make it just slightly bigger than our camera (which is representedby the outerblue border line behind our image), to do this you must first size it just inside the camera (as shown in Figure 3.1.2), then scale it out just beyond the cameras borders. Figure 3.1.2 3.2 Setting our backgrounds layer Now one more thing we need to do before we can add the next two background images, we need to set this backgrounds layer. Change the backgrounds layer to 30 (as shown in Figure 3.2.1). Now the Fish should be visible again (as shown in Figure 3.2.4). Figure 3.2.1 3.3 Adding and layering our rock images Now that we know the process for adding, positioning and layering our full screen background images, lets repeat the process for our two rock images. These will need to be added in a layer above the background image, but behind the fish image. We also will want to put a bit of a gap between the two rock layer images so our fish can be made to swim in between them. Click the Create tab to see our images again. Now drag the first rock image, the third image in our Static Sprites library (as shown in Figure 3.3.1), into the center of your level. Just like our background image, click one of the corners and hold the shift key to drag it proportionally, do this       ");

Moving our Fish 2.1 Add our fish Before we can move a fish, we must first have a fish. Fortunately, this is a simple step. Click and drag one of the fish animations from the Animated Sprites seciton of t he Object Library (as shown in Figure 2.1.1) into the center of our level.. Figure 2.1.1 Now that we have our fish in our level, our next step will be to get it moving. This requires some scripts, so we are going to link the object to script. We do this by giving our object a class in the Level Builder. Change the fishs class to PlayerFish (as shown in Figure 2.1.2). Figure 2.1.2 This is all the work we can do in the Level Builder before touching a little bit of script. Because of this ability to link a class in the Level Builder, this next step is very easy. 2.2 Saving out our level Before we exit, we want to make sure we save our level properly. That way when we load it up, our fish is already placed with its class already set. Save the level as myFishlevel. 2.3 Creating our movement script file Open the directory where youcreated your project and then open the game/gameScripts folder. This is where your game scripts should be located. Presently, you should only see a game.cs file in this location. (.cs is the Torque Script file extension). In this folder we can create additional script files to build up our game; we will begin with movement. Create a text file in this folder and name it player.cs. Be sure you add the .cs extension so T2D will recognize it as a script file. Now you can open your newly created player.cs in any text editing program. (At the least, Windows users can right-click and choose Open With to use either Notepad or Wordpad. Mac users can control-click and choose Open With to use TextEdit). If you remember, we set our fishs class to PlayerFish. So we are going to add the following function to our player.cs. function PlayerFish::onLevelLoaded(%this, %scenegraph) { } Code Sample 2.3.1 As you may notice, we sta      ");

This tutorial set will take you through creating a very simple fish themed game in Torque 2D. This tutorial is ideal for those new to coding and/or scripting as well as those who are familiar with it and are just new to Torque 2D (T2D). This is divided into multiple steps with each step being a different document, that way it should be easy to follow and pick up at a later time. 1. Starting Out 1.1 Create our project Our first step is to create a new project in Torque 2D. To do this we must first open T2D. After loading the application you should be presented with the T2D Level Builder. Make a new project and name it MyFishGame using the Empty Game project template. After you click create you should be presented with your new project with a fairly bare object library on the right panel (as shown in figure 1.1.3). As you can see, with just a couple of clicks you can have a new project. Figure 1.1.3 1.2 Bring in needed images Now we need to bring in some fish images to make our demo out of. To do this we must load a resource. Import the fishArt resource. 1.3 Finished! We have successfully completed the first step in our Fish Game! We now have a new project and the proper images loaded into the Level Builder to begin creating our level and fish, in our next step we will setup keys to control the movement of a fish.

Adding a Scrolling Wave 9.1 Adding our wave We now have multiple fish swimming around. We can also add new fish with all of the proper settings by utilizing our config datablock. Now we can proceed to add polish to our fish demo. We can add an extra visual aspect, in the form of a scrolling wave, to make our demo look much better. You may have seen the wave image in either your Static Sprites object library or your Scrollers object library. We can add it, set its alpha level to make it more transparent, and then give it a scroll speed so it makes our water look like its waving. Figure 9.1.1 Find your Scroller object library. The fourth scroller should be your wave image (as shown in Figure 9.1.1). Drag and drop the wave scroller into the center of your level (as shown in Figure 9.1.2). Resize the wave scroller to extend just beyond the left and right horizontal limits of the level, as well as making it a bit taller than it is by default. (as shown in Figure 9.1.3). Figure 9.1.2 Figure 9.1.3 Now that we have our wave added, its a bit too visible. We want our wave to be more transparent, so its much more of a subtle effect. To lower its visibility click the Edit tab. Then click the Blending label to expand the blending options (as shown in Figure 9.1.4). Here we can change multiple things that will effect either our objects color, blending process, or its alpha layer (transparency). To lower the transparency change the value in the Alpha box to around 150 (as shown in Figure 9.1.5). Now your wave image should look much more transparent. Figure 9.1.4 Figure 9.1.5 With our wave images transparency set, we can now make it scroll. This will complete the wave illusion and effect. To do this click the Scroller label in the edit panel to expand it, and set its Scroll Speed X to 3 and press enter (as shown in Figure 9.1.6). Now your wave should scroll properly!

Config Datablock 8.1 Scripting a config datablock Now that we have our fish behaving properly, we need to duplicate that fish. One way we could do that would be to drag over new animated fish and set up each of the settings weve already set. Fortunately, there is an easier way to accomplish this: we can use a config datablock. A config datablock is just a basic object that can hold any sort of object data. This would be object data that you want to be repeated across multiple objects. When you create an object, you can specify a config datablock, and all valid data will be used. If your object has already set a data value, which is also set on the config datablock, then your objects data will take precedence (as it should). As you can imagine this is immensely useful for assigning similar data to multiple objects. Browse out to your MyFishDemo/game/gameScripts folder and locate a file named datablocks.cs .Add this config datablock to the end of your file. datablock t2dSceneObjectDatablock(FishDatablock) { Class = FishClass; Layer = 16; WorldLimitMode = NULL; WorldLimitMin = -66.2102 -45; WorldLimitMax = 66.1003 45; WorldLimitCallback = 1; minSpeed = 5; maxSpeed = 25; }; Code Sample 8.1.1 As you can see, we have all the important values we just set on our single fish. The two values you might not be familiar with are the WorldLimitMin and WorldLimitMax values. From -66 to 66 it spans the entire space that we visually specified in the Level Builder. We have a class of FishClass, our layer as 16, our proper world limit mode and min and max values, and our callback option. We also have our two dynamic fields for our min and max speeds. Make sure you save your datablocks.cs file. 8.2 Creating fish using our config datablock Now that we have our config datablock, we need to allow T2D to register it. This requires you to click the Project -&gt; Reload Projectoption. This will close and reload the current project to register our new confi      ");

Random Speeds 7.1 Setting up speed values in the Level Builder Now our fish swims back and forth, and comes in at a random position when it reaches the world limits. In this part we are going to take it a step further. We will make it come in at random speeds. Not only are we going to make it come in at random speeds, we are going to define the min and max random speeds in the Level Builder; so you will learn another level of integration between the Level Builder and script. Utilizing this type of integration can be immensely useful when you begin to develop your games, this allows you to configure aspects of your game inside of the Level Builder. Select the fish and add two Dynamic Fields: minSpeed with a value of 5 to give our fish a min speed value (as shown in Figure 7.1.2) and also maxSpeed with a value of 25 (as shown in Figure 7.1.3). Now our fish will have the minSpeed value of 5 and the maxSpeed value of 25 attached to it. So when we access the fish in script we can reference these min and max values to get the random speed. Save your level and open up your game.cs again (if you dont already have it open). Figure 7.1.1 Figure 7.1.3 Figure 7.1.2 Add this function to the end of the script file. function FishClass::setSpeed(%this) { %this.speed = getRandom(%this.minSpeed, %this.maxSpeed); } Code Sample 7.2.1 This function will get a random value between the min and max we just specified in the Level Builder. It will store this speed value on the fish object itself, that way we can reference it when we set the fishs velocity. We need to now restructure our onLevelLoaded() function, as well as our onWorldLimit() function. So switch your functions out with these. function FishClass::onLevelLoaded(%this, %scenegraph) { %this.setSpeed(); %this.setLinearVelocityX(%this.speed); } function FishClass::onWorldLimit(%this, %mode, %limit) { %this.setSpeed(); switch (%limit) { case left: %this.setLinearVelocityX(%this.speed); %this.setFl      ");

Come in at a Random Position 6.1 Adding a random Y position to our script Now that we have our fish swimming back and forth properly, we can add a couple of things to make it a bit more interesting. One of these things is to place our fish in a random Y position when it flips and swims back across the screen after hitting a world limit. This will give the illusion of another fish swimming in, or at least as though our fish was moving vertically and not just horizontally. If you dont still have it open, open your game.cs script file again. Locate your onWorldLimit() function. It should look like this. function FishClass::onWorldLimit(%this, %mode, %limit) { switch (%limit) { case left: %this.setLinearVelocityX(20); %this.setFlipX(false); case right: %this.setLinearVelocityX(-20); %this.setFlipX(true); } } We need to add a call to both the “left” and “right” responses. This call will set the fishs Y position in a random number between the top of the level and just above the ground. Make your function look like this. function FishClass::onWorldLimit(%this, %mode, %limit) { switch (%limit) { case left: %this.setLinearVelocityX(20); %this.setFlipX(false); %this.setPositionY(getRandom(-35, 25)); case right: %this.setLinearVelocityX(-20); %this.setFlipX(true); %this.setPositionY(getRandom(-35, 25)); } } Code Sample 6.1.1 We get a random number between -35 and 25 to set our fishs Y position to. This way the fishs Y position will change when it hits the world limit. It will now swim in at a different position than where it left. Click the Play Level button and you should see your fish swim out of the level and in at a random position (as shown in Figure 6.1.1). Or, just make sure you followed the steps exactly.

Making our Fish Swim Back and Forth 5.1 Setting up our fishs world limit Now that our fish is swimming in one direction, we need it to swim from one side of the level to the other. We can accomplish this easily using our fishs world limit. The world limit is a bounding box that we can define visually in our Level Builder. This is the world bounds for our fish object. We can also make it send a script callback to our fish class when it reaches the edge of its world limit. A script callback says to the engine, call this script whenever this event happens. (This is different from a script execution, which is done to tell T2D where scripts we need are located.) By attaching a script callback to the world limit, we tell our fish to swim back and forth. So, change the fishs world limits extend slightly outside the camera (as shown in Figure 5.1.3). Our purpose for this is to give enough space between the camera limit and the world limit for the entire width of the fish to fit, that way we dont see it turn around. Figure 5.1.3 Now that the world limit boundary is set, we need to configure the settings for it. If you havent already exited out of the World Limit Boundary Tool, click on the Selection Tool in the top toolbar (as shown in Figure 5.1.4). Figure 5.1.4 Now that we are out, click the Edit tab to look at our fishs settings again. This time we are going to expand the world limit settings by clicking the World Limits label (as shown in Figure 5.1.5). The default world limit is set to OFF. Click the dropdown and change it to NULL (as shown in Figure 5.1.6). As you can see, there are a few other options such as BOUNCE, CLAMP, etc. In our case we dont want any physics response, and we want to control the response by script, so NULL works perfectly. We also need to check the Callback box to ensure our script will be called when the fish reaches the world limit. (See Figure 5.1.7.) Figure 5.1.5 Figure 5.1.6 Figure 5.1.7 5.2 Scripting our      ");

To do this, browse out to your project folder, wherever you created it, and then to the gameScripts folder, MyFishDemo/game/gameScripts/. In this folder you should see a game.cs file.

Drag and drop the animated sprite from your object library into the center of your level (as shown in Figure 3.1.2).

Adding these will really enhance the look of our fish demo. In your right panel make sure that the Create tab is selected. Scroll down and click the Particle Effects label. Its hard to tell what the two particle effects are, since neither of them are meant to be highly visible. They are fairly subtle effects. The first one is for creating new effects, the second one is the bubble effect and the third one is the light beam effect. Drag and drop the second effect, oceanbubbles.eff (as shown in Figure 10.1.1) to the lower left of your level, between two of the rocks (as shown in Figure 10.1.2). Figure 10.1.1 Figure 10.1.2 If you wait a moment after you drop the bubble particle effect, you will see bubbles floating upward. Drag a second bubble particle effect, and this time drop it in the bottom right of your level between some other rocks (as shown in Figure 10.1.3).

A little background information Drag this image from your browser onto T2D: caption background.png From the Create pane in T2D, drag the backgroundMaterial you just added into the Scene View area, to create a static sprite that we can use as the background of our scene. Go to the Edit pane, and enter 0 for both Position X and Position Y -- this will center the sprite in the scene. For Width enter 100, and for Height enter 75. This will make the sprite exactly match the viewable area of the default camera, so the image will completely fill up the background of the scene. For Layer, enter 31. Higher layers are further back in the scene, so we want our background to be very far back. When we dragged the image onto T2D, it updated the project file to include the image. Since we updated the project file and the scene, we need to save it. From the menu, choose File -&gt; Save and replace Untitlted.t2d with Rainy Day Level.t2d and click OK.

If you are completely new to Torque, specifically T2D, I recommended you go through the other tutorials found in this documentation first. Making Our Fish Move In this section we are introduced to behaviors in the process of creating a movement behavior. We set this movement behavior up to take key input to allow us to configure our movement keys inside the Level Builder itself. First you want to create a new project. I named mine MyFishTutorial. Next, bring up the resources menu (Project-&gt;Resources...) and add the fishArt resource. Now you should have a fresh project with a set of fish images. We are ready to begin making our quick, behavior based, fish game. Fish Controls Behavior For our fish game we need only three behaviors. Behaviors are sets of scripts we can create and then assign to various object inside the Level Builder. Not only can we assign them but we can configure different values to customize the behavior. We will need to create three different behaviors for this quick and simple game, as follows: Controls, for using the keys to control our player Our interactive objects, to allow them to add and subtract life from our player Life management, adding/subtracting life from our player as well as slowly draining life Now that we know what we need, our next steps will be adding the scripts for each of these and then testing them. We are going to add a behavior that we want to show up in the Level Builder, so close down T2D. Create a script file called fishControls.cs inside your Project Directory/game/behaviors folder, using the following code: if(!isObject(fishControlsBehavior)) { %template = new BehaviorTemplate(fishControlsBehavior); %template.friendlyName = Fish Tutorial Controls; %templa      ");

There are many attributes that you can set on this object, but right now we are most concerned with behaviors. Open the Behaviors menu: Figure 4 There is a green button and a dropdown menu. Open the dropdown menu; this is a list of all the behaviors that you can add to objects in this project. Figure 5 Under the Input subcategory you will see the Flee Mouse behavior. Select it, then click the green button to add it to the sprite. You can also delete this behavior from the sprite by clicking the red button. Youll notice two options for this behavior: Impulse and Damping (See Figure 6). You can experiment with changing these values later. Figure 6 Now run your game. When you move the cursor close to the sprite, it should start to move away from you! Figure 7 Onward! Now that you know how to add behaviors to objects, try changing the impulse and damp values, then reloading the game to see how the sprites behavior changes. You can also try adding different behaviors to sprites. When youre ready, you may want to jump into scripting a game that uses behaviors, such as the Fish Game Tutorial. Have fun!

Tile maps have been around for years and are still used for modern 2D games. The artwork used in a tile map can drastically alter the perspective of a game, such as top-down or 3/4 views. In almost every case, a tile map will have repeating elements. The main advantage to using a tile map is conserving memory. Rather than having several large images on multiple layers, you can use a single tile map and hand paint your level. This requires a little more work and some extra CPU processing, but the gains of memory optimization and extended customization create some balance. Importing Tile Map Art Creating a tile map is a multi-step process, but a very simple one. The following portion of this guide can be applied to all your asset importing and setup. Loading the image will be the same process as any other sprite. In the Create tab, click on the Create a new ImageMap button. When the file browser appears, navigate to the directory containing your spritesheet and open the image. For this guide, the tgb/resources/starterArt/images/tilemap.png artwork is used: (click to enlarge) After you open the artwork, a new imageMap is created. Tiles are treated similarly to Animated Sprites. Each tile should be in a separate cell, which means you need to edit the imageMap in the Image Builder.

Think of them like a rollercoaster track - a path could be laid down to resemble a series of complex movements, and can then have a car placed on it to move and follow its curves. Paths are good if, for example, you have a sawblade that you wish to have move around the edges of a platform. Through simple properties, you can set the sawblade to follow the path around the platform forever. Creation Open the Create Panel by pressing cmd-c or tapping on the Create tab. Find the Other drop-down section at the bottom of the Create panel. Here you will find the Path Object. Click on the Path Object and drag it into your Scene. Release the mouse button when you have found a proper location for the path. The path object now exists but it has no nodes. A path must have at least two nodes to be valid. Click the mouse on where you want your path to start, and again where you want your path to end. Now press Enter to close the Path Editor.

In this guide, you will learn how to create particle effects in Torque 2D. Particle effects are commonly used for things like explosions, rain, smoke, etc. Particles are generated automatically by a set of parameters inside of an emitter, which can be edited visually. A single particle effect can contain multiple emitters, which is a powerful system for creating amazing and complex effects. Adding Particle Art Like every other object that renders to the scene, particle effects require an ImageMap. Before creating the particles, you need to import the image. Under the Create tab, click on the Create a new ImageMap button. Locate the image you will use for the particle effect. For this example, the particles from the RainyDay demo are used: Double click on the particlesImageMap entry. As with Animated Sprites and Tile Maps, this ImageMap needs to be in Cell format. Click on the Image Mode dropdown to display a list of options. Choose the Cell entry to split the image up into four parts. Because of the resolution and number of cells, this operation should automatically split the image evenly. This automatic operation only works for images containing 2x2 cells. You can still set the values for Cell Count X and Cell Count Y to 2 and see that the effect is the same. Make sure your final version looks similar to the following: Note: In most cases it is best to disable the Filter Pad check box and set Filter Mode to NONE.
