                <p>This is a Windows security issue. UAC is preventing Torque 2D from 
                  saving out the necessary files required to create and open projects. To 
                  resolve this issue, you must go through the following steps on Windows 7
                  or Windows Vista: </p>
                <p><br />
                  1. Please navigate to the target file/folder. </p>
                <p>2. Right-click on the file/folder and choose Properties. </p>
                <p>3. Click the "Security" tab and see if your current user is 
                  listed in the "Group or user names" list. If not, please click Edit-&gt;
                  Add button, type the name of your current user in the "Enter the object
                  names to select " box, then click "OK" to add this group. </p>

                <br><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> Why do my images show in the editor, but not in the game? </span></h2>
                <p>You need to add your imageMaps to the level's datablocks file. You 
                  can do this using the Level Datablocks Editor. Once you have added them,
                  you will be able to see your images during game play. You can see an 
                  example of this in the Rainy Day tutorial. </p>
                <p><br />
                  The Level Datablocks system is an optimization feature. When you are 
                  editing your project in the Torque 2D Editor, all of the sprites, 
                  animations, scrollers, tilemaps and so on are loaded into memory at all 
                  times. However, you may not need all of them for every single level. </p>
                <p>For example, you may only need four specific sprites and 
                  animations for one level, then a completely separate set in another 
                  level. The Level Datablocks editor allows you to manually control what 
                  gets loaded on a per-level basis, thus reducing the overall memory 
                  consumption of your game. </p>
                <a name="How_do_I_create_new_level_datablocks_files.3F" id="How_do_I_create_new_level_datablocks_files.3F"></a>
                <br><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> How do I create new level datablocks files? </span></h2>
                <p>Each level needs to have its own datablocks file. Typically, the 
                  editor will create the file automatically when you create a new level. 
                  If you are porting an older project, you will need to manually create 
                  the file. For example, let's say you create a new level called 
                  myLevel.t2d. You should create a myLevel_datablocks.cs file in 
                  level/datablocks directory. Simply creating the file will link it to 
                  your project and the Level Datablock Editor will handle the rest. </p>
                <a name="Why_can.27t_I_see_sprites_larger_than_the_camera_area.3F" id="Why_can.27t_I_see_sprites_larger_than_the_camera_area.3F"></a>
                <br><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> Why can't I see sprites larger than the camera area? </span></h2>
                <p>This is an optimization that can be toggled on and off. The 
                  optimization prevents unnecessary rendering of objects outside of the 
                  camera view, but it is applied to any sprite that is outside the 
                  boundaries (regardless of it being inside as well). Here are the steps 
                  to disable this optimization: </p>

                <p>Yes, behaviors are still used. Any behaviors added to the folder 
                  named "behaviors" in your game's projectFiles/scripts/ directory. Any 
                  behavior scripts you put in that folder will automatically load into the
                  engine. </p>

                <br><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> How can I make my game run faster? </span></h2>
                <p>There are several methods of optimization. The following tips are not
                  always required, but you can cherry pick from them to see if they 
                  improve your games' performance: </p>
                <ul>
                  <li> Try to keep your individual art files square and at a power of two resolution (64x64, 128x128, 256x256, etc) </li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                  <li> Extremely complex and math heavy code is best kept in C++. 
                    Native code, such as C++, will always execute faster than a scripting 
                    language. TorqueScript is still useful for creating game play, but 
                    sometimes it is worth diving into C++ to create the complex parts </li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                  <li> Combine images together into an "atlas". If you have four 
                    images that are all static (not animated) and can fit in a 512x512 or 
                    lower image, you should use the UnChaos tool. You can find this in the 
                    tools folder where you installed Torque 2D. This tool will create a new
                    image file (png) containing your selected sprites and arrange them in 
                    an optimal way. You will be provided with texture coordinates, which are
                    fed into the Source Rect property of a sprite in the editor. </li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                  <li> When you can, pool objects. For example, let's say your game 
                    has enemies spawn off screen and move into the camera view. The player 
                    is able to destroy these enemies, thus removing them from the scene. 
                    Rather than delete those objects, disable their visibility and move them
                    off screen. From there, reset their state or restore their original 
                    values then send them back at the player. This avoids constantly 
                    creating and destroying objects, which will use less of the CPU and 
                    memory. </li>
                </ul>

                <p>GarageGames does not provide exact dates for product releases. You 
                  can track progress on development in the Torque 2D forums, where we 
                  will reveal new features, new documentation and some plans for the 
                  future. </p>

                <p>Anytime you see a feature in another engine that is
                  not supported in Torque 2D, feel free to post a suggestion in our 
                  forums. When a demand becomes popular amongst the community, there is a 
                  good chance it will rise in our priority for a future release. </p>

                <p>GarageGames has the best developer community you will find on the 
                  web. We always appreciate people who are willing to give back to the 
                  engine. If you have a sample game or code you want to share, jump to our
                  resource section of the site to post it for everyone to enjoy. </p>

                  If you are in a helping mood, lurk in our IRC channel to talk to other 
                  developers and help solve problems. This is a live chat room where 
                  experienced Torque 2D users and GarageGames employees lurk, waiting to 
                  help those with emergency problems. </p>

                  The forums are perhaps our best support tool. Just by asking a question 
                  and getting an answer, you will help everyone else who might run into 
                  the same problem. Don't be shy, join the employees and your fellow
