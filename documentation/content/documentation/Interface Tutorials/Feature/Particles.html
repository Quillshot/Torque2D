<H2>Introduction</H2>

<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=justify STYLE="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In
this tutorial, you'll learn how to create particle effects in Torque
2D (T2D).  Particle effects are commonly used for things
like explosions, rain, smoke, and lots of other cool special effects.
With practice, you'll be able to use the T2D particle builder to
create some really amazing visual effects.  To be exact, a 'particle
effect' is a group of similar graphics that combine to make an
interesting visual effect.  Particle effects are generated
automatically by a set of parameters that can be edited in Torque
2D. They also move automatically according to a similar set
of parameters. One example of a particle effect is a cloud of smoke
that is made of a bunch of small smoke-puff graphics that move around
in a cluster.  Another example would be rain, which might be made of
a bunch of raindrops that move from the top of the screen to the
bottom.</FONT></FONT></P>
<h2>Preparation</h2>
</FONT>
<p CLASS="western" ALIGN=justify STYLE="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in; FONT-STYLE: normal"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>To
prepare for this tutorial, you need to have additional particles and assets currently not in the T2D install. Next, run Torque 2D and load the <I>TutorialBase</I>
project (if it's not already loaded) by choosing <I>Open Project...</I><SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: normal">
from the file menu and selecting </SPAN><I>games/TutorialBase/project.t2dProj</I><SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: normal">.
 Then, create a new scene. Finally, save this new scene  as "ParticleTutorial".</SPAN></FONT><BR></p>
<H2>Creating A New Particle Effect</H2>
    <P CLASS="western" ALIGN=justify STYLE="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in; FONT-STYLE: normal">
        <FONT SIZE=3 face="Arial, sans-serif">The Torque 2D
particle system is extremely versatile and includes a multitude of
features. This allows you to create, effectively, an infinite number
of cool effects.  When dealing with something that has this many
options, it's usually good to have an idea of what you want to create
before you start working.  For this tutorial, we'll be making a
simple explosion that consists of fire shooting out in all directions
with a puff of smoke in the center.</FONT></P>

<BR>

<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=justify STYLE="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in; FONT-STYLE: normal">
<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>To see some examples of
particle effects, open the <I>Particle Effect </I>section in the
<I>Create Tab</I>.  In there, you'll see many examples.  When you
hover over them with the mouse, you can see them animate.  These
particle effects can be dragged into the <I>Scene View</I> if you
want to see them in action.  When you are done viewing them, you can
select them by clicking on the center of the effect and pressing the
<I>Delete</I> key.</FONT></FONT></P>

<BR CLEAR=left><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>To
start working on our new effect, drag the first entry, <I>newEffect.eff</I>,
onto the <I>Scene View</I>.  It starts out emitting a &quot;Test
Texture&quot; graphic by default. In order to start editing its
properties, go to the <I>Edit </I>tab and open the <I>Particle Effect</I>
section. Note that if you click on the graph icon on the left of this
section's label, it will open the graph editor rather than the
<I>Particle Effect</I> section itself.  Also, in order to get a good
view of the <I>Edit</I> tab, you may want to drag its left border
further to the left so that you can read all of the properties.</FONT></FONT>

<H2>Particle Effects and Emitters</h2>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=justify STYLE="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in; FONT-STYLE: normal">
<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN >Before
you dive into making an effect, <FONT COLOR="#000000">let's talk
about a couple of important particle concepts in Torque 2D:
'effects' and 'emitters'. A particle 'effect' is the whole particle
effect that we save off, including one or more emitters.  An
'emitter' is a component of a particle effect which will generally
create one type of particle.  For example, in this tutorial the fire
will be created by one emitter, and the smoke by another. The
particle 'effect' will be the combination of these two emitters. This
technique of combining multiple emitters can make some really
mind-blowing particle effects.</FONT></SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<BR>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=justify STYLE="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in; FONT-STYLE: normal">
<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>First, Type "Fireball" into the <I>Create Emitter</I>
text box and press the plus sign next to it.  </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then, click the big &ldquo;Delete This Emitter&rdquo;
button on the default test emitter. </FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE=3>A new <I>Emitter</I> subsection appears in the <I>Particle Effect</I> section.  We're
still not seeing anything in the <I>Scene View</I>, but that's about
to change.  In the <I>Emitter </I>subsection, find the <I>Image</I> dropdown, which contains all the available sprites in the project,
and select <I>particles1ImageMap</I>.  Now you can see some tiny
fireballs shooting out in a circle.  Remember, you can zoom in and
out of the <I>Scene View</I> with the '+' and '-' keys if you want a
better look.</FONT></FONT></P>

<BR>

<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=justify STYLE="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in"><IMG SRC="images/ParticleFigure2.png" ALT="Frame2" ALIGN=bottom><BR>
<BR>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=justify STYLE="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>So
now we've created our 'emitter' that is spraying out 'particles': the
fireballs. Already this effect is pretty neato, but it's definitely
not the explosion we're looking for. For one thing, the fireballs are
too small and they go too far.  For another, we don't want them
shooting out in this strange pattern. Before going on, press the <I>Save
Effect</I><SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: normal"> button and name the new
effect "simpleExplosion.eff".  Remember to use this save
button whenever you want to save your particle effects... <U>simply
saving a scene that contains a particle effect will not save the
particle effect in it!</U></SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>

<H2>Using the Graph Editor to Change Size</H2>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=justify STYLE="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in; FONT-STYLE: normal; TEXT-DECORATION: none">
<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>We'll cover the
properties shown in the <I>Particle Effect</I> and <I>Particle
Emitter</I> sections later.  For now, we're going to explore the real
powerhouse of T2D particle system... the graph editor.  We want to
edit the graph of our emitter, so click on the graph icon next to the
<I>Emitter - Fireball</I> label.  The dialog that pops up is the
graph editor, which is used to edit our particles' properties <U>over
time</U>.  If you don't understand what that means, you will by the
end of this tutorial.</FONT></FONT></P>
<IMG SRC="images/ParticleFigure3.png" NAME="Frame3" ALT="Frame3" ALIGN=bottom>
<BR>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=justify STYLE="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in; FONT-STYLE: normal; TEXT-DECORATION: none">
<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>To see a list of emitter
properties that you can access with the graph, click the <I>Current
Field </I>dropdown <I>(as shown in Figure 3)</I>.  Dang, that's a lot
of options!  That's why it's a good idea to have some idea what
you're trying to create before you jump in. Select <I>Size X Life</I>
from the list.  This property defines the size of our particles
during their lifetime. The point on the far left is the starting
point.  Click on the point and you'll see its starting value, which
is 0,1.  The first of these numbers is the time, and the second
number is the value.  In this case, at time zero (when the particle
is created) the <I>Size X Life</I> value is one.  Drag that point up
and down.  You can see your particles change size as you do this. 
Leave the point at around 0,3.5.  If your particle effect is hidden
behind the graph editor, move it so you can see it as you work, like
this:</FONT></FONT></P>

<BR>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=justify STYLE="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in; FONT-STYLE: normal; TEXT-DECORATION: none">
<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Now, we want to make our
fireballs get smaller and smaller until they disappear a little ways
from the selection box of our particle.  To do this, add a new point
in the middle area of the graph by clicking there.  Drag the point
around until the fireballs shrink to nothing just outside the
selection box.  What you are doing is creating a graph of the
particles' size. They start full size at time zero (the 0,3.5 point),
then shrink as time progresses to the right.  </FONT></FONT>

point in the graph editor, you can simply right-click on it.  Note
that you are not allowed to delete the point at time 0 (the far left

<H2>Using The Graph Editor To Fade</H2>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=justify STYLE="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in; FONT-STYLE: normal; TEXT-DECORATION: none">
<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Right now the fireballs
just shoot out and shrink, then disappear instantly... what we really
want is for them to fade out quickly at the end, like a real
explosion.  To do this we'll use the property called <I>Visibility
Life</I>, which controls the particles' transparency.  In the graph
editor <I>Current Field</I> dropdown, select that property.  To begin
with, create a point in the middle of the graph, then drag it all the
way to the bottom.  Now drag that point left and right until you can
see the particles fading out at the end of their lifespans, but make
sure they still last long enough to reach the edge of the selection
box. This makes the particles fade gradually throughout their life,
but what we really want is for them to stay at full intensity until
about halfway through their life, then fade out.  All we have to do
is create a new graph point between the two points you already have,
and drag that point straight up to the top of the graph.  Now, when a particle is created it is fully
visible. It stays that way until halfway through its life, then it
fades out to nothing.  If you have trouble seeing this effect, close
the graph editor and zoom into your particle effect with the '+' key.</FONT></FONT></P>

<H2>Using the Graph Editor on the Effect Scene</H2>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=justify STYLE="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in; FONT-STYLE: normal; TEXT-DECORATION: none">
<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Okay, the effect is
starting to look pretty cool, but we wanted an explosion, not a
continuous spray of fire. To change this, we're going to edit some
effect properties, as opposed to <U>emitter</U> properties, which is
what we have been editing. Scroll up to the main <I>Particle Effect</I>
section and open the graph.  Select <I>Quantity Scale</I> from the
<I>Current Field</I> dropdown. This property affects the quantity of
particles produced.  Raise that initial point all the way to the top
of the graph (0, 20).  Well, now it's sort of exploding, but it seems
to last forever.  What we want is to produce this quantity of
particles, but only for a second, and then stop.  Like you did in the
last section, add a couple more points... one at around 0.9, 20 and
the other at around 1, 0.  When you put
in the point at 1,0 you'll see the particle effect stop producing
particles... this is because the <I>Quantity Scale</I> goes down to
zero, meaning zero particles will be produced.  To see your effect
continue to generate, change the <I>Effect Mode </I>property in the
<I>Particle Effect </I>section to <I>CYCLE</I>.  Next change the
<I>Effect Lifetime </I>to "2".  Now the effect starts over
(or 'cycles') every 2 seconds... 2 because the <I>Effect Lifetime</I>
is set to 2.  Good stuff...  the effect is looking a little more like
an explosion now!</FONT></FONT></P>

<H3>Creating A Second Emitter</H3>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=justify STYLE="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in; FONT-STYLE: normal; TEXT-DECORATION: none">
<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Let's quickly go through
making a second emitter.  This will make the explosion look more real
by adding smoke and it will also solidify your understanding of using
the particle editor.  To begin, type "Smoke" into the
<I>Create Emitter</I> text box, and press the plus sign to create. 
You can now scroll down to the <I>Emitter - Smoke </I>section.</FONT></FONT></P>
<BR>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=justify STYLE="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in; FONT-STYLE: normal; TEXT-DECORATION: none">
<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>First we need an image. 
Actually, this time lets use an animation... in the <I>Animation</I>
property, which contains all the animated sprites from your project,
select <I>flamesAnimation</I>.  Open the emitter's graph editor and
change <I>Size X Base </I>point to around 0,5.  Now we can see our
smoke animation.  Change the <I>Quantity Base </I>point to around 0,
20.  Now change the <I>Speed Base</I> point to 0, 0.5 to stop the smoke
from rushing away.</FONT></FONT></P>
<BR>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=justify STYLE="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in; FONT-STYLE: normal; TEXT-DECORATION: none">
<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>For the next property,
we're going to use the text boxes on the bottom of the graph editor. 
Select <I>Speed Variance</I> in the dropdown and try to set it the
point to 0, 0.5.  It's pretty hard to be exact because the graph is 0
on the bottom and 1000 on the top.  These numbers are defined by the
<I>Value (Min/Max)</I> properties.  Drag the point down to the
bottom, then change the <I>Value Max</I> property to "10"
and press <I>Enter</I>.  Now the graph goes from 0 on the bottom to
<U>10</U> on the top.  Position the <I>Speed Variance </I>around 0, 0.5.  Note that if you needed to, you could
change the <I>Time (Min/Max)</I> properties to affect the
left-to-right scale of the graph also. Keep in mind that you can tailor these values to your liking, and your values may not always be identical to these screens.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The last change to make
in the graph editor is to <I>Visibility Life</I>.  Put points near 0,
0 then 0.3, 0.3 then 0.7, 0.  This
makes the smoke fade in and out nicely. If you think the smoke lags behind the explosion, modify your first point's value to something close to 0, 0.1.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This tutorial has covered
enough to get you started with particles in T2D.  As you've seen,
though, there are an incredible number of options available to you
using this system.  This tutorial did not cover most of the options
available in the emitter and effect graphs.  For information about
these, see the <I>Particle Engine</I> reference document.  Also, as
mentioned above, one of the best ways to learn about the particle
system is just to play with it and see what kind of effects you can
come up with.  It will be well worth your while to experiment with
every property described here and in the <I>Particle Engine</I>
document.  Enjoy!</FONT></FONT></P>
