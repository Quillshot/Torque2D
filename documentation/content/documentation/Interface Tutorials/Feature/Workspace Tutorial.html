                <p>When creating a new project in Torque 2D, it is important 
                  to know how to adjust your workspace and how the adjustment affects your
                  workflow. In this tutorial we are going to cover how to change your 
                  design resolution, how to change your camera view, and how changing your
                  workspace in these ways will affect your project. </p>
                <p><br />
                  This tutorial will be using the stock TutorialBase project file that 
                  comes with the engine. To open that file, launch T2D and click <i>Open 
                  Project</i>. If you are already editing a project, click on <b>File-&gt;Open
                  Project...</b> Once the file browser is open, navigate to the <i><strong>games/TutorialBase</strong></i> folder. Select the <b>project.t2dProj</b> file to begin. </p><br><br>

                <h2> <span class="mw-headline">Camera View and Design Resolution</span></h2>
                <p>Your camera view is defined in T2D as a box with a thick border 
                  around it. The color is based on your Scene Editor grid color 
                  preferences (<strong>Edit-&gt;Preferences</strong>, Scene Editor tab). Though games can 
                  take up much more space than this square, all that will be visible to 
                  the end-user is what is inside of this square at any given moment (<i>as
                  shown in Figure 1</i>): </p>
                <p><br />
                  <img alt="Image:WorkspaceFigure1.jpg" src="images/WorkspaceFigure1.jpg" border="0" height="480" width="640" /><br />
                  <b>Figure 1</b> </p><br><br>
                <p>To begin, let's start by dragging in one of the graphics from the
                  <strong>Static Sprites</strong> library. I chose to drag in the GarageGames logo (as 
                  shown in Figure 2). As you can see, once I drop the graphic in my scene,
                  it is automatically resized in the view. This is because of the design 
                  resolution. </p>
                <p><br />
                  The design resolution is the size that T2D is going to assume your 
                  camera view is. When it resizes graphics, it is going to resize them 
                  relative to what the design resolution currently is. By default, the 
                  design resolution is set to 800 x 600 - therefore all graphics that are 
                  dragged into the scene will be sized properly relative to the camera 
                  view. </p>
                <p><br />
                  <img alt="Image:WorkspaceFigure2.jpg" src="images/WorkspaceFigure2.jpg" border="0" height="459" width="612" /><br />
                  <b>Figure 2</b> </p>
                <p><br />
                  To access your design resolution, go up to the<strong> Edit Menu</strong> and choose
                    <strong>Preferences</strong> (<i>as shown in Figure 3</i>): </p>
                <p><br />
                  <img alt="Image:WorkspaceFigure3.jpg" src="images/WorkspaceFigure3.jpg" border="0" height="237" width="162" /><br />
                  <b>Figure 3</b> </p>
                <p><br />
                  Once you click <strong>Preferences</strong>, you should be confronted by a dialog that 
                  contains all of your preference settings. You will see three tabs along 
                  the top of the dialog. Click on the tab marked "<strong>Scene Editor</strong>" (<i>as 
                  shown in Figure 4</i>). </p>
                <p><br />
                  <img alt="Image:WorkspaceFigure4.jpg" src="images/WorkspaceFigure4.jpg" border="0" height="395" width="510" /><br />
                  <b>Figure 4</b> </p>
                <p><br /><br>
                  When you click on the Scene Editor tab of your preferences, you should 
                  see Figure 5. About halfway down on the left side of your Scene Editor 
                  preferences is the Design Resolution (as shown in Figure 5). As you can 
                  see, the design resolution defaults at 800 X 600. </p>
                <p><br />
                  <img alt="Image:WorkspaceFigure5.jpg" src="images/WorkspaceFigure5.jpg" border="0" height="395" width="510" /><br />
                  <b>Figure 5</b> </p>
                <p><br /><br>
                  Let's change the design resolution to something else so you can see the 
                  effect it has on your workspace. Change your design resolution to 1024 X
                  768 (<i>as shown in Figure 6</i>). </p>
                <p><br />
                  <img alt="Image:WorkspaceFigure6.jpg" src="images/WorkspaceFigure6.jpg" border="0" height="26" width="177" /><br />
                  <b>Figure 6</b> </p>
                <p><br /><br>
                  Now that you have changed the design resolution of your workspace, let's
                  see what it does to your project. Grab another one of those GarageGames
                  logos and drop it right next to the one we dragged in their earlier. 
                  Immediately you should notice something: the logo is sized smaller than 
                  it was before (<i>as shown in Figure 7</i>). </p>
                <p><br />
                  <img alt="Image:WorkspaceFigure7.jpg" src="images/WorkspaceFigure7.jpg" border="0" height="135" width="226" /><br />
                  <b>Figure 7</b> </p>
                <p><br />
                  As stated above, T2D automatically resizes graphics in relation to the 
                  design resolution. Since the design resolution is 1024 X 768, all of the
                  subsequent graphics placed in the workspace are going to be smaller. 
                  You should also note that <em>no graphics placed in the workspace before 
                  changing the resolution are affected</em>. </p>
                <p><br />
                  Change your design resolution back to default (800 X 600) and delete the
                  second logo we created. Now we are going to explore another method of 
                  setting up your workspace: the Camera Tool. </p><br><br>
                <a name="The_Camera_Tool" id="The_Camera_Tool"></a>
                <h2> <span class="mw-headline">The Camera Tool</span></h2>
                <p>The Camera Tool allows users to manually change the size of their 
                  camera view. The <strong>Camera Tool</strong> is located along the top bar of the 
                    <strong>Scene Editor</strong> (<i>as shown in Figure 8</i>): </p>
                <p><br />
                  <img alt="Image:WorkspaceFigure8.jpg" src="images/WorkspaceFigure8.jpg" border="0" height="89" width="204" /><br />
                  <b>Figure 8</b> </p>
                <p><br />
                  When you click on the Camera Tool, your view zooms out and shows you 
                  your Camera View as a translucent box with resize handles along the 
                  outer edges (<i>as shown in Figure 9</i>). You can resize your view in 
                  many ways: </p>
                <p><br />
                  <img alt="Image:WorkspaceFigure9.jpg" src="images/WorkspaceFigure9.jpg" border="0" height="480" width="640" /><br />
                  <b>Figure 9</b> </p>
                <p><br />
                  First, if you click on any resize handle and drag it in any direction, 
                  the camera view will resize around its origin while keeping its default 
                  aspect ratio (<i>as shown in Figure 10</i>). </p>
                <p><img alt="Image:WorkspaceFigure10.jpg" src="images/WorkspaceFigure10.jpg" border="0" height="170" width="217" /><br />
                  <b>Figure 10</b> </p>
                <p><br />
                  Second, if you click on any resize handle while holding the 
                    <strong>CTRL</strong> key, it
                  resizes the camera view keeping the same aspect ratio while anchoring 
                  the camera view to the opposite handle as you are grabbing (<i>as shown 
                  in figure 11</i>). </p>
                <p><br />
                  <img alt="Image:WorkspaceFigure11.jpg" src="images/WorkspaceFigure11.jpg" border="0" height="178" width="241" /><br />
                  <b>Figure 11</b> </p>
                <p><br />
                  Third, if you click any of the resize handles while holding the 
                    <strong>SHIFT</strong> 
                  key, it resizes the camera view from the center but does NOT keep the 
                  aspect ratio. This gives the user the opportunity to mess up the aspect 
                  ratio of the scene (not recommended) (<i>as shown in Figure 12</i>). </p>
                <p><br />
                  <img alt="Image:WorkspaceFigure12.jpg" src="images/WorkspaceFigure12.jpg" border="0" height="190" width="181" /><br />
                  <b>Figure 12</b> </p>
                <p><br />
                  Finally, if you click on any of the resize handles while holding the 
                    <strong>SHIFT</strong> and <strong>CTRL</strong>, your camera view will resize freely from an anchor point
                  opposite the one you grabbed without keeping the aspect ratio (<i>as 
                  shown in Figure 13</i>). </p>
                <p><br />
                  <img alt="Image:WorkspaceFigure13.jpg" src="images/WorkspaceFigure13.jpg" border="0" height="245" width="230" /><br />
                  <b>Figure 13</b> </p>
                <p><br />
                  Neither of the last two methods are recommended in most cases since if 
                  you mess up the aspect ratio you will get an interesting, skewed look to
                  your graphics. However, T2D still allows you to affect the aspect ratio
                  in case you ever work with an unusual aspect ratio such as those found 
                  on a widescreen monitor, etc. </p>
                <p><br />
                  We now want to make the camera view larger. To do that, use either of 
                  the first two methods to enlarge the camera view to a reasonably larger 
                  size. To save the changes you have made to your camera view, click on 
                  the selection tool (<i>as shown in figure 14</i>) or hit Enter. </p>
                <p><br />
                  <img alt="Image:WorkspaceFigure14.jpg" src="images/WorkspaceFigure14.jpg" border="0" height="105" width="177" /><br />
                  <b>Figure 14</b> </p>
                <p><br />
                  Once you have your camera view changed and saved, drag another copy of 
                  the GarageGames logo into the scene to see its effects. Your new graphic
                  should be larger than your original graphic, due to the relative sizing
                  of the design resolution (as shown in Figure 15) </p>
                <p><br />
                  <img alt="Image:WorkspaceFigure15.jpg" src="images/WorkspaceFigure15.jpg" border="0" height="116" width="155" /><br />
                  <b>Figure 15</b> </p>
                <p><br />
                  Even though we made the camera view cover a much larger area, T2D still 
                  assumes that it represents an 800 X 600 screen and therefore sizes any 
                  newly imported graphics appropriately. </p><br><br>

                <h2> <span class="mw-headline">Conclusion</span></h2>
                <p>This tutorial covered the basics of setting up a workspace, changing 
                  the camera view and design resolution, and the effect it can have on a 
                  project. As you become more familiar with this aspect of T2D, you will 
                  learn to use the methods outlined above to streamline your workflow and 
                  make your games more efficiently with minimal resize issues. You can 
                  create all of your art for one resolution and have it sized 
                  automatically in relation to your camera view or design resolution. I 
                  hope this tutorial proves useful. Good luck! </p></td>
