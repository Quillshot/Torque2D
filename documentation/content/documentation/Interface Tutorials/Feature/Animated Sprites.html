                <p>In this tutorial, you'll learn how to set up and use animated sprites
                  in Torque 2D. An 'animated sprite' is a two-dimensional image that has 
                  multiple frames, like a movie. This tutorial will focus on Torque 2D features 
                  that are unique to animated sprites. In addition to these features, 
                  animated sprites can be manipulated in many of the same ways as static 
                  (non-animated) sprites, which you can learn about in the Static Sprite 
                  Tutorial. </p>
                <p><br />
                  To prepare for this tutorial, run Torque 2D and create a new 
                  project. Name the new project "AnimatedSprites" and use the Empty Game project template. This 
                  creates a new project called AnimatedSprites in the location you 
                  chose to save it to. </p>
                <br><br>

                <h2> <span class="mw-headline">Loading The Image Files</span></h2>
                <p>We'll need to add a couple of images to the AnimatedSprites project for 
                  this tutorial. To do this we will learn a convenient way to 
                  bring images into Torque 2D. Simply drag Figure 1 and Figure 2 from 
                  this html document into your Torque 2D window with your new project 
                  loaded. </p>
                <p><br />
                  <img alt="Image:imageMap1234.png" src="images/imageMap1234.png" border="0" height="64" width="64" /><br />
                <p><br />
                  <img alt="Image:FlourSack.png" src="images/FlourSack.png" border="0" height="448" width="510" /><br />
                <p><br />
                  This should bring them into your object library, though as full 
                  images.These images are "CELL" images, so double click their icons
                  in the object library and set them up according to the following instructions. </p>
                <p><br />
                  In the Image Builder dialog, change the Image Mode to CELL (as shown in 
                  Figure 3). CELL mode is used for images that are evenly divided into 
                  multiple frames. The default is four equally-sized frames, which is 
                  correct for this image, so press Save. </p>
                <p><br />
                  <img alt="Image:AnimatedSpritesFigure3.png" src="images/AnimatedSpritesFigure3.png" border="0" height="400" width="698" /><br />
                <p><br />
                  Now it's time to adjust the FlourSack image. Double click on the 
                  FlourSack imageMap. Choose CELL image mode. The frames don't look quite 
                  right, so we're going to adjust the cell sizes. For starters, change the
                  Cell Width to "85" and press Enter. </p>
                <p><br />
                  That looks like the right width. Let's assume that the cells are as tall
                  as they are wide and change the Cell Height to "85" also. The result 
                  does not look perfect. Enter "112" instead (as shown in Figure 4). It 
                  should look a lot better. Click Save. </p>
                <p><img alt="Image:AnimatedSpritesFigure4.png" src="images/AnimatedSpritesFigure4.png" border="0" height="397" width="702" /><br />

                <p><br />
                  Your sprites now appear in the Static Sprites section. To set them up 
                  for the Animated Sprites section, we will use the Animation Builder. To 
                  do this, click the Create a new Animation button under the Create tab 
                  (as shown in Figure 5). In the <i>Select Material</i> dialog, select 
                  imageMap1234ImageMap then press the <i>Select</i> button (as shown in 
                  Figure 6). </p>
                <p><br />
                  <img alt="Image:AnimatedSpritesFigure6.png" src="images/AnimatedSpritesFigure6.png" border="0" height="436" width="596" /><br />
                <p>This brings up the Animation Builder, with its default settings 
                  selected. The biggest area of the Animation editor (center/lower left) 
                  you can see all the available cells of the image map, which are used as 
                  frames in your animation. </p>
                <p><br />
                  On the top is the Animation Storyboard where you can arrange these 
                  cells. On the right side in the upper right you can see a preview 
                  animation window, below that are various options and a save and cancel 
                  button. </p><br><br>

                <h2> <span class="mw-headline">The Animation Builder</span></h2>
                <p>Now it's time to take a closer look at the Animation Builder 
                  features. Let's take a look at the animation properties ... </p>
                <ul>
                  <li><b>Frames Per Second:</b> Number of frames you want played each 
                    second (speed of the animation). </li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                  <li><b>Start Frame:</b> This is the frame you want the animation to 
                    start at. </li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                  <li><b>Total Time:</b> The number of seconds in one cycle of the 
                    animation. The frame times will be divided evenly, so, in this 
                    animation, 4 frames in one second will result in .25 seconds per frame. </li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                  <li><b>Cycle Animation: </b>If checked itmakes the 
                    animation start back at the beginning after completing its 
                    cycle.If this isn't checked it means the animation will play 
                    once, then stop on the final frame. </li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                  <li><b>Name:</b> The name of the animation. </li>
                </ul><br><br>
                <a name="The_Animation_Storyboard" id="The_Animation_Storyboard"></a>
                <h2> <span class="mw-headline">The Animation Storyboard</span></h2>
                <p>To create your own animation drag your animation frames from the 
                  Source ImageMap section into the Animation Storyboard (or just click the
                  green plus to add all of the frames). Let's make this one run 
                  backwards... </p>
                <p><br />
                  <img alt="Image:AnimatedSpritesFigure7.png" src="images/AnimatedSpritesFigure7.png" border="0" height="405" width="564" /><br />
                <p><br />
                  Start by dragging the "4" image into the first frame in the storyboard. 
                  Now continue dropping frames in... "3"... "2"... "1".You should 
                  see the preview, in the top right, playing your animation as you build 
                  it.Be sure to modify the Frame Per Second field if your animation 
                  is going to fast. </p><br><br>
                <a name="The_FlourSack_Animation" id="The_FlourSack_Animation"></a>
                <h2> <span class="mw-headline">The FlourSack Animation</span></h2>
                <p>Let's do one more animation as an example... one that's a little 
                  cooler than flashing numbers. Back in the Create tab, click on Create a 
                  new Animation and select FlourSackImageMap as the source 
                  image.Click on the green plus (Add all the frames from the image) 
                  button to add all of your frames. Hey, that looks pretty cool! But what 
                  is that flash at the end of the animation? </p><br>
                <p><img alt="Image:AnimatedSpritesFigure8.png" src="images/AnimatedSpritesFigure8.png" border="0" height="405" width="563" /><br />
                <p><br />
                  Go back to the storyboard and scroll down to the end. You'll see that 
                  there is an empty frame there . This is because when you import your 
                  image using the Image Mode Cell, it divides the image into equal frames 
                  per row based on the frame size you specify. </p>
                <p><br />
                  Since this animation has an odd number of frames, when the Image Map 
                  Builder created it, there was a blank one at the end. Drag the last frame off of 
                    the animation list and drop it on the trash can icon to remove it from the 
                    animation, then preview it again. Now that looks really 
                  good! Return to the storyboard and save the animation using the default 
                  name. </p>
                <p><br />
                  Back in the Scene Editor, drag the animated flour sack from the Create 
                  tab onto the left side of the Scene View. With that animated sprite 
                  still selected, click the Edit tab on the right side of the screen and 
                  open up the Physics section in that tab. Type "10" into the Velocity X 
                  property and press Enter. </p>
                <p><br />
                  Save your level, then press the Play Level button. You should see the 
                  sack walking across the screen. </p>
                <p><br />

                <p>We've thoroughly explored the setup of animated sprites in Torque 2D. To 
                  further your understanding, it will be worth your while to go through 
                  the Image Maps tutorial. That will explain how to create the celled 
                  image maps that are used to make these frame-based sprites. </p>

                  Now that you have the tools, the possibilities for cool and interesting 
                  animations are pretty much limitless! Have fun with it! </p></td>
