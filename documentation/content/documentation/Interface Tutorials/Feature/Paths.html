                <h2> <span class="mw-headline">Introduction</span></h2>
                <p>In this tutorial, you'll learn how to create paths and attach objects
                  to them in T2D. A path is a series of points called 'nodes' that are 
                  connected together by various means. The Scene Editor provides a tool 
                  with which paths can be created and edited, and objects can be attached. </p>
                <p><br />
                  The path object in T2D (t2dPath) is a scene object itself, so it can do 
                  things like have velocities applied, react to physics, and even attach 
                  to another path. For this tutorial, we will be using the Torque 
                  2D project called TutorialBase. </p>
                <p><br />
                  Run Torque 2D. If the project is not already loaded, select <i>Open
                  Project</i> from the File menu, then select <b>TutorialBase/project.t2proj</b> from the list and press OK. Also, if you had previously created a level
                  with this project it will be loaded. In this case, select <i>New Scene</i> from the File menu. </p><br><br>
                <a name="Creating_a_Path" id="Creating_a_Path"></a>
                <h2> <span class="mw-headline">Creating a Path</span></h2>
                <p>Select the create tab in the side panel, scroll down to the <i>Other</i> rollout, and click and drag the GarageGames logo labeled <i>Path</i> into your scene. </p>
                <p><br />
                  <img alt="Image:PathsFigure1.png" src="images/PathsFigure1.png" border="0" height="370" width="289" /><br />
                <p><br />
                  Visibly, it won't seem like much happened, but what you just did was 
                  activate the path tool. The path tool allows you to create, move, and 
                  delete path nodes. To create a node, simply click somewhere in the 
                  scene. To move any of these nodes, you can click on them and drag the 
                  mouse. </p>
                <p><br />
                  To delete a node, right click on it. You will notice that the path nodes
                  follow the snap settings of the editor just like sizing and moving 
                  object. To turn off grid snapping, click on <b>Edit-&gt;Preferences...</b> in the menu. In the Scene Editor tab, uncheck <i>Snap to X Axis</i> and <i>Snap to Y Axis</i>. </p>
                <p><br />
                  Create a path with four nodes. When you have finished, press Enter on 
                  the keyboard or click on the arrow (labeled Selection Tool) in the 
                  toolbar. It's very important to note that creating a path with 0 nodes 
                  could result in bugs or a crash. Here is the path I created: </p>
                <p><br />
                  <img alt="Image:PathsFigure2.png" src="images/PathsFigure2.png" border="0" height="540" width="711" /><br />
                <br>
				<a name="Attaching_an_Object" id="Attaching_an_Object"></a>
                <h2> <span class="mw-headline">Attaching an Object</span></h2>
                <p>Now, create an object by dragging an image from the Static Sprite 
                  rollout in the object library onto the scene. I used the GarageGames 
                  logo. With your mouse hovered over the newly created object, 5 widgets 
                  will appear above it. Select the one labeled Mount this object to 
                  another object. </p>
                <p><br />
                  <img alt="Image:PathsFigure3.png" src="images/PathsFigure3.png" border="0" height="140" width="293" /><br />
                <p><br />
                  The object will now be attached to your mouse, following it wherever you
                  drag it. If the mouse gets near a path node, the object will snap to 
                  it. When this happens, you can click the left mouse button, and the 
                  object will attach itself to the path with the default settings. </p>
                <p><br />
                  <img alt="Image:PathsFigure4.png" src="images/PathsFigure4.png" border="0" height="122" width="620" /><br />
                <p><br />
                  Now, select Save As... from the File menu, enter a filename for your 
                  level, and press save. Then, select Run Game from the Project menu. You 
                  should see a black screen with the GarageGames logo moving automatically
                  along the path you created. </p>
                <p><br />
                  Of course, it's moving kind of slow, and possibly not in the direction 
                  you want it to. Luckily, there are several parameters you can configure 
                  specifically for pathed objects. </p><br><br>

                <h2> <span class="mw-headline">Editing the Pathed Object</span></h2>
                <p>Make sure the GarageGames logo object is selected, then click on the 
                  Edit tab in the side panel. Scroll down to the section titled Pathing 
                  and click on it to expand the rollout. </p>

                <p><br />
                  Here is a brief description of the purpose of each of the fields: </p>
                <ul>
                  <li><b>Start Node</b> - The start node is the node in the path that 
                    the object will start at. Click the left and right buttons and the 
                    pathed object will move to the corresponding node on the path. </li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                  <li><b>End Node</b> - The end node defines the end of the path for 
                    this object. This is the node at which the object will stop after it has
                    completed the specified number of loops, or at which it will perform 
                    its Follow Mode action in Reverse or Restart mode. This option has no 
                    effect if Wrap is selected as the Follow Mode and -1 is selected for 
                    Loops. </li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                  <li><b>Speed</b> - This is the speed at which the object will follow
                    the path in world units per second. </li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                  <li><b>Move Forward</b> - Unchecking this box will reverse the 
                    direction that the object travels around the path. </li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                  <li><b>Orient To Path</b> - Selecting this option will cause the 
                    object to rotate itself depending on the direction it is traveling. </li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                  <li><b>Rotation Offset</b> - The rotation offset only affects 
                    objects that have Orient to Path selected. With a rotation offset of 0, 
                    the top of the objects will be facing toward the direction they are 
                    moving. Changing this allows you to specify the exact rotation at which 
                    the object should orient itself. </li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                  <li><b>Loops</b> - This specifies the number of times the object 
                    will travel around the path. The default value of -1 specifies an 
                    infinite number of loops. When the number of loops has been reached, the
                    object will stop at the end node. </li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                  <li><b>Follow Mode</b> - The follow mode tells the path what to do 
                    with the object when it reaches the end node. It comes in three flavors.
                    In Wrap mode, the object will continue in the same direction around the
                    path. In Reverse mode, the object will change its direction and the 
                    start node will become the end node. In Restart mode, the object will 
                    warp back to the start node upon reaching the end node. </li>
                </ul>
                <p><br />
                  All of these options are applied specifically to the pathed object, not 
                  the path itself. So, if you had several objects attached to the same 
                  path, they could all configure themselves differently. </p><br><br>
                <a name="Editing_the_Path" id="Editing_the_Path"></a>
                <h2> <span class="mw-headline">Editing the Path</span></h2>
                <p>Paths can be edited after creation. To do this, select the path and 
                  click on the widget labeled Edit this path. </p>
                <p><br />
                  <img alt="Image:PathsFigure6.png" src="images/PathsFigure6.png" border="0" height="115" width="229" /><br />
                <p><br />
                  This will reactivate the path tool, allowing you to create, edit, or 
                  delete nodes. Paths also allow you to specify the method they use to 
                  interpolate between nodes. There are four options available that can be 
                  selected in the Path rollout of the Edit tab in the side panel. </p>
                <p><br />
                  <img alt="Image:PathsFigure7.png" src="images/PathsFigure7.png" border="0" height="152" width="302" /><br />
                <p>Here is the description of each of these types: </p>
                <ul>
                  <li><b>Linear</b> - This is the default and simply has an object 
                    move in a straight line from node to node. </li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                  <li><b>Bezier</b> - The bezier method uses cubic bezier splines to 
                    create a curved interpolation between each node. Each node is guaranteed
                    to be a part of the path. Bezier paths have two additional parameters, 
                    Rotation and Weight. </li>
                </ul>
                <p><br />
                  These parameters can be edited in the path tool when bezier is selected 
                  as the Path Type by clicking and dragging the handles around each node. </p>
                <p><img alt="Image:PathsFigure8.png" src="images/PathsFigure8.png" border="0" height="125" width="142" /><br />
                <ul>
                  <li><b>Catmull</b> - The catmull type uses Catmull-Rom splines to 
                    interpolate between nodes. This method requires no extra tweaking and 
                    automatically generates a smoothly curved path that goes through each 
                    node. </li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                  <li><b>Custom</b> - The custom method does not actually move any of 
                    the objects automatically. Instead, it executes a callback that can be 
                    defined in script to move the object. This would be useful in cases 
                    where you have a path for an enemy to follow, but you don't want it to 
                    follow it directly. This way, the enemy could still obey things like 
                    collision and gravity, but still have an easy to define and follow path.
                    The callback looks like this: </li>
                </ul><br><br>
                <pre>function t2dPath::onUpdatePath(%this,%object,%from,%to)
{
   //%this is the path object.
   
   //%object is the object following the path.
   
   //%from is the position of the most recently passed node.
   
   //%to is the position of the node being moved toward.
}
</pre><br><br>

                <h2> <span class="mw-headline">Conclusion</span></h2>
                <p>This tutorial has covered all the features of the T2D path object. 
                  The best way to figure out the effect these features have on pathed 
                  objects is to experiment. Paths can be useful for certain game types and
                  menu screens, but their coolest effect comes from combining them with 
                  particle effects to make screen saver looking levels.</p></td>
