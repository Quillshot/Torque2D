                <p>When it comes to special effects, particles are the first thing you 
                  should think of when making a game. In this guide, you will learn how to
                  create particle effects in Torque 2D. Particle effects are commonly 
                  used for things like explosions, rain, smoke, etc. </p>
                <p><br />
                  Particles are generated automatically by a set of parameters inside of 
                  an emitter, which can be edited visually. A single particle effect can 
                  contain multiple emitters, which is a powerful system for creating 
                  amazing and complex effects. </p>
                <a name="Adding_Particle_Art" id="Adding_Particle_Art"></a>
                <br><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> Adding Particle Art </span></h2>
                <p>Like every other object that renders to the scene, particle effects 
                  require an ImageMap. Before creating the particles, you need to import 
                  the image. Under the Create tab, click on the "Create a new ImageMap" 
                  button. Locate the image you will use for the particle effect. For this 
                  example, the particles from the RainyDay demo are used: </p>
                <p><br />
                   </p>
                <p><img alt="Image:SelectParticlesImage.jpg" src="images/SelectParticlesImage.jpg" border="0" height="433" width="719" /> </p>
                <p><br />
                  Double click on the particlesImageMap entry. As with Animated Sprites 
                  and Tile Maps, this ImageMap needs to be in Cell format. Click on the 
                  Image Mode dropdown to display a list of options. Choose the <b>Cell</b> entry to split the image up into four parts. Because of the resolution 
                  and number of cells, this operation should automatically split the image
                  evenly. </p>
                <p><br />
                  This automatic operation only works for images containing 2x2 cells. You
                  can still set the values for Cell Count X and Cell Count Y to 2 and see
                    that the effect is the same. Make sure your final version looks similar to 
                  the following: </p>
                <p><br />
                   </p>
                <p><img alt="Image:ParticlesImageBuilder.jpg" src="images/ParticlesImageBuilder.jpg" border="0" height="414" width="714" /> </p>
                <p><br />
                  <b>Note:</b> In most cases it is best to disable the Filter Pad check box and set Filter Mode to "NONE". </p>
                <p><br />
                  The new imageMap will appear in the Static Sprites rollout in a cell 
                  format. Notice it just shows one frame, which you can cycle through by 
                  clicking the numbers below the preview: </p>
                <p><br />
                  <img alt="Image:NewParticleAdded.jpg" src="images/NewParticleAdded.jpg" border="0" height="184" width="248" /> </p>

                <br><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> Creating A New Effect </span></h2>
                <p>This guide will create a very simple effect which will produce 
                  several raindrops going toward the bottom of the scene. To get started, 
                  open up the Create tab and scroll down to the Particle Effects rollout. 
                  Unless you have created effects previously, there should be only one 
                  entry called newEffect: </p>
                <p><br />
                  <img alt="Image:ParticleEffectsRollout.jpg" src="images/ParticleEffectsRollout.jpg" border="0" height="139" width="171" /> </p>
                <p><br />
                  Left click on that entry and drag it into your scene. When you let go of
                  the mouse button, a blank particle effect is added to the scene. This 
                  effect is essentially temporary. You can edit it all you want, but it 
                  will need to be saved if you wish to use it in the future. For now, it 
                  should not be doing anything: </p>
                <p><br />
                   </p>
                <p><img alt="Image:BlankParticleAdded.jpg" src="images/BlankParticleAdded.jpg" border="0" height="416" width="494" /> </p>
                <p><br />
                  Switch to the Edit tab while you have the new effect selected. Scroll 
                  down to the Particle Effect rollout. You should only have the base 
                  effect data. Click in the <b>Create Emitter</b> text box and type 'drops'. Then click on the green plus button to add the new emitter: </p>
                <p><br />
                   </p>
                <p><img alt="Image:NameDropsEmitter.jpg" src="images/NameDropsEmitter.jpg" border="0" height="247" width="415" /> </p>
                <p><br />
                  At this point you should have a default emitter. Since there is no 
                  image, animation or frame associated with the emitter, your effect 
                  should still show nothing. Your default emitter should look like this: </p>
                <p><br />
                   </p>
                <p><img alt="Image:DropsEmitterRollout.jpg" src="images/DropsEmitterRollout.jpg" border="0" height="537" width="415" /> </p>
                <a name="Editing_An_Effect" id="Editing_An_Effect"></a>
                <br><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> Editing An Effect </span></h2>
                <p>The first major change you need to make to the emitter is to supply 
                  it with an imageMap. The effect needs to know what it should be drawing 
                  to the screen. Click on the <b>Image</b> drop down box and select the particlesImageMap you imported earlier: </p>
                <p><br />
                   </p>
                <p><img alt="Image:SetParticleImageMap.jpg" src="images/SetParticleImageMap.jpg" border="0" height="100" width="415" /> </p>
                <p><br />
                  You should immediately see particles rendering in your scene after 
                  selecting the particlesImageMap. Unless you made any other previous 
                  changes, this emitter will be rendering the first frame (or cell) from 
                  the imageMap. This would be the sparkle image: </p>
                <p><br />
                   </p>
                <p><img alt="Image:SparklyRain.jpg" src="images/SparklyRain.jpg" border="0" height="469" width="480" /> </p>
                <p><br />
                  Move further down in the emitter properties and locate the <b>Frame</b> section. Set this to 1 to use the second cell in the imageMap because 
                  this is the portion of the image containing the rain drop: </p>
                <p><br />
                  <img alt="Image:RainFrame1.jpg" src="images/RainFrame1.jpg" border="0" height="162" width="403" /> </p>
                <p><br />
                  Next, scroll down until you see the various check boxes which control the base particle behavior. Disable <b>Use Effect Emission</b> checkbox. This tells the effect to use the emitter property instead of the base effect graph: </p>
                <p><br />
                  <img alt="Image:DisableUseEffectEmission.jpg" src="images/DisableUseEffectEmission.jpg" border="0" height="159" width="161" /> </p>
                <p><br />
                  Notice how all the rain drop particles are shooting in every direction 
                  from the center of the emitter. Rain typically falls in a straight line down 
                  from a source (like a cloud). To change the origin of particle 
                  creation, scroll down to the <b>Type</b> property. Click on the drop 
                  down, then select <strong>LINEX</strong>. This means the particles will be generated 
                  across a horizontal line, instead of a single center point or area: </p>
                <p><img alt="Image:SetLinex.jpg" src="images/SetLinex.jpg" border="0" height="89" width="377" /> </p>
                <p><br />
                  Now it's time to really change the particle emitter behavior. Locate the <b>Edit Emitter Graph</b> button. You will want to left click this to start changing the emitter properties: </p>
                <p><br />
                  <img alt="Image:EditEmitterGraph.jpg" src="images/EditEmitterGraph.jpg" border="0" height="68" width="423" /> </p>
                <p>A small dialog will pop up with a particle property selected. This is the emitter graph. If you click on the <b>Current Field</b> drop down, you will see all the properties you can change for this emitter: </p>
                <p><br />
                   </p>
                <p><img alt="Image:EmitterValueList.jpg" src="images/EmitterValueList.jpg" border="0" height="542" width="263" /> </p>
                <p><br />
                  Don't panic. You do not need to change all the properties to simulate 
                  rainfall. Only five properties need to be modified. From the Current 
                  Field drop down, locate and select <b>Size X Base</b>. Left click on the
                  red dot in the graph, then drag it up to around 30. It does not 
                  have to be completely perfect, just as close as you can get it: </p>
                <p><br />
                  <img alt="Image:SetRainSizeBase.jpg" src="images/SetRainSizeBase.jpg" border="0" height="287" width="271" /> </p>
                <p><br />
                  If you click in a blank area of the box, you will create a new value 
                  node. This does not change the initial value of the Size X Base. What 
                  this does is tell the particle being emitted to change its horizontal 
                  size over time. This allows for more advanced particle effects, but it's
                  not something you need right now. To get rid of this, right click on 
                  the new node. </p>
                <p><br />
                  You should now be able to see rain drops being emitted from your effect.
                  Look at the preview to make sure you can see the small white drops 
                  being created. Don't worry about what they are doing just yet. All that 
                  matters is you can see them. If not, increase the size a little more to 
                  your liking: </p>
                <p><br />
                  <img alt="Image:BiggerRain.jpg" src="images/BiggerRain.jpg" border="0" height="204" width="206" /> </p>
                <p><br />
                  The rain is currently shooting in every direction. This is controlled by the <b>Emission Arc Base</b>. Switch to that field and you should see the stock value of 360: </p>
                <p><br />
                  <img alt="Image:ArcBaseBefore.jpg" src="images/ArcBaseBefore.jpg" border="0" height="287" width="271" /> </p>
                <p><br />
                  This correlates to a circle, with the graph representing values from 0 
                  to 360 degrees. The node is currently at 360, which causes the particles
                  to shoot in every direction.  We want our particles emitting in a 
                  straight line from a single line emitter. To achieve this, drag the 
                  value node down to the very bottom. This results in a value of 0: </p>
                <p><br />
                  <img alt="Image:ArcBaseAfter.jpg" src="images/ArcBaseAfter.jpg" border="0" height="287" width="271" /> </p>
                <p><br />
                  Moving on, select the <b>Emission Angle Base</b> field. You will notice 
                  your rain is falling in the wrong direction. It is going straight up, 
                  which is not a desired emission. This is the stock angle ejection for 
                  particles. If you think about circles, what value represents a point or 
                  rotation in the exact opposite direction? The answer is 180 degrees. </p>
                <p><br />
                  The stock values for <b>Emission Angle Base</b> will be -360 / 360, with
                  a time of 0 / 1. This means you can drag the value node anywhere 
                  between -360 (bottom) to 360 (top). You may find it difficult to carefully nudge the node 
                  somewhere in the top area to get close to an accurate 180. A handy trick
                  is to change the <b>Value (Min/Max)</b>. </p>
                <p><br />
                  Set the Value Min to 0, then the Value Max to 180. Now, setting the 
                  particle emission to go in the exact opposite direction is as simple as 
                  dragging the value node to the top of the graph: </p>
                <p><br />
                  <img alt="Image:SetAngleBase.jpg" src="images/SetAngleBase.jpg" border="0" height="287" width="271" /> </p>
                <p><br />
                  Our current rainfall is a light sprinkling, which can barely sustain 
                  life on the ground. You need to increase the amount of particles that are 
                  generated by this emitter. Switch to the <b>Quantity Base</b> field, then set the value to something close to 45. This should give us enough rain to work with: </p>
                <p><br />
                  <img alt="Image:SetQuantityBase.jpg" src="images/SetQuantityBase.jpg" border="0" height="287" width="271" /> </p>
                <p><br />
                  Finally, you need to adjust how quickly the rain falls. If this were 
                  snow, you would want to slow it down. Since this is rain, you should 
                  increase the force used to eject particles downward. Switch the current 
                  field to <b>Emission Force Base</b>. If you have not adjusted any values you will be working with a huge range of -1000 to 1000. </p>
                <p><br />
                  Remember the trick shown earlier for setting the Emission Angle Base 
                  range? Repeat this process for the Emission Force Base. Set the Value 
                  Min to 0 and Value Max to 100. This makes it a lot easier to move the 
                  value node to something small, like 17 or 18: </p>

                  That's it! Click the close button on the emitter graph and admire your 
                  new rain particle effect. You can always go back into the emitter 
                  properties and tweak the effect until you are happy with it: </p>

                <br><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> Saving Effects To File </span></h2>
                <p>One last step remains. This new effect is still just temporary. 
                  Torque 2D particle effects need to be saved out to a file. This allows 
                  your game to load the effect when it needs it and provides you with the 
                  option to share particle effects with other projects or teams. </p>
                <p><br />
                  Scroll back to the top of the Particle Effect rollout. Look for the <b>Save Effect</b> button. Click that button, then choose a directory in your game project to save the effect. For this example, a <i>particles</i> folder was created in the projectFiles/game/data directory. Set the file's name to <b>rain.eff</b>, then click Save. </p>
                <p><br />

                <p><br />
                  That's it! Making rain fall is not a complex effect, nor does it require
                  a lot of work. However, there are plenty of tweaks that could be made 
                  to the effect. For example, if you know there will be a "wind" factor in
                  your game, you can change the motion variance so the rain does not 
                  always fall in a straight line. </p>

                <p>All movement and life properties of Effects and Emitters in Torque 2D
                  are modified by a simple graph system. This graph system allows a 
                  single property to have an effect that gets stronger or weaker at any 
                  desired speed during the course of the life of a single particle, or 
                  during the life of the Emitter as a whole. </p>

                <p><br />
                  The lower a node is on the graph, the lower the number. The higher a 
                  node is on the graph, the higher the number. The far-left is at time 
                  '0.0' of the life, while the far-left is at the end, or time '1.0' of 
                  the life. </p>

                  More nodes can be simply added by clicking on the graph. Clicking and 
                  dragging on a node will move it, while right-clicking on a node will 
                  remove it.
