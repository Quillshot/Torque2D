        <h2> <span class="mw-headline">Torque Technology</span></h2>
        <p>Torque 2D is the world's most powerful and easy-to-use 2D game engine. 
			Built atop the common Torque core architecture, it offers many of the features 
			of our cutting-edge 3D game engine, but customized for 2D gameplay. 
			Development paths allow publishing to Windows and Mac. 
			And with its intuitive and powerful editor, anyone can jump into game creation 
			with little to no prior knowledge. </p>
        <p><br />
          Using a game engine is not just a shortcut to finishing a game. Using 
          Torque 2D will save you the time and effort required to create a 
          complex rendering system, real time editors, and a scripting system. 
		  However, you must also realize that there is a lot of power "under 
          the hood" that should be harnessed. </p>
        
		<br><a name="The_Engine" id="The_Engine"></a>
        
		<h2> <span class="mw-headline">The Engine</span></h2>
        <p>The engine, also referred to as the source code, was developed 
          entirely in C++ and Objective C. The most important thing to realize 
          about Torque 2D is that it is a large, complex system. Having source 
          code access allows you to extend the engine to be whatever you want and 
          optimize game play code using a native language. </p>
        <p><br />
          For instance, if you wish to add in MYSQL functionality or integrate 
            <a href="http://www.box2d.org/">Box2D</a>, the path is not closed to you. Another benefit of having source 
          code access is the ability to read through the comments and structures 
          to gain a better understanding of how the script system is set up. </p>
        <p><br />
          Do not be intimidated. If you wish to start working with the engine, you
          can do so whenever you feel comfortable. These docs will not force you 
          into the engine. </p>
        <br><a name="TorqueScript" id="TorqueScript"></a>
        <h2> <span class="mw-headline">TorqueScript</span></h2>
        <p>TorqueScript is a very powerful, flexible language with syntax 
          similar to C++. The benefit of writing script code is that you do not 
          have to recompile your executable, which means you do not have to dive 
          into the source code. Simply create or modify a script, save it, then 
          run the game to see the effects. You MUST restart your game in order to 
          see the script changes. </p>
        <p><br />
          To utilize TorqueScript you do not need to be a code guru or know the 
          nitty-gritty specifics of a particular language like C++. If you are 
          already familiar with the basics of computer programming, you already 
          have a head start using this system. </p>
        <p><br />
          Even without prior experience coding or scripting, <a href="../Scripting/Overview/Introduction.html">we have included 
          several TorqueScript articles</a> that will teach you syntax, 
          functionality and how to use it in conjunction with the engine and 
          editors. Still, the more past programming experience you have, the 
          further ahead you will be when picking up Torque 2D. </p>
        <br><a name="Editors" id="Editors"></a>
        <h2> <span class="mw-headline">Editors</span></h2>
        <p>A large part of your initial learning experience will have you working with Torque 2D's editors. 
		   The key term to remember is <b>WYSIWYG</b>, which stands for 
		   <b>W</b>hat <b>Y</b>ou <b>S</b>ee <b>I</b>s <b>W</b>hat <b>Y</b>ou <b>G</b>et. 
		   This means you can modify your game's level and immediately receive visual feedback on how it looks. </p>
        <p><br />
          <b>Builder</b> - The Builder is where you will spend 99% of your time 
          when putting together your levels, importing assets, building particles,
          etc. It is actually a collection of editors that work together to help 
          combine multiple elements of your game: Collision Editor, Particle 
          Editor, Scene Editor and so on. You can even tie script code and 
          behaviors to objects through the Builder. </p>
        <p><b>GUI Editor</b> - GUI stands for Graphical User Interface. 
          Examples GUIs include splash screens, options dialogs and sometimes in 
          game HUD (Heads Up Display). With the GUI Editor, you can design and 
          create your menus, player inventory, a health bar, loading screens, etc. </p>

        <p>Now that you have read though this article, you are familiar with some of the most important 
		   aspects of Torque 2D. As you familiarize yourself with Torque 2D, you may also want to take a
