Installing TSTK for TGE
-----------------------

1. Copy the folder "TSTK" from wherever you unzipped it into your TGE "examples\" directory.  This is usually something like: "C:\TGE_1_5_2\example\".
2. Edit the file "~\example\main.cs".
3. Locate the following lines:

$isDedicated = false;
$modcount = 2;
$userMods = "creator;" @ $defaultGame;


4. Change the above lines to:

$isDedicated = false;
$modcount = 3;
$userMods = "TSTK;" @ "creator;" @ $defaultGame;

5. Save "~\example\main.cs".
6. Run TGE as you normally do.  TSTK is installed. :)
