Installing TSTK for TGB Editor
------------------------------

1. Copy the folder "TSTK" from wherever you unzipped it into your TGB root directory.  This is usually something like: "C:\TGB_Pro_1_7_4\tgb\".
2. Edit the file "~\example\main.cs".
3. Locate the following lines:

loadPath( "common" );
loadPath( "tools" );


4. Change the above lines to:

loadPath( "common" );
loadPath( "tools" );
loadPath( "TSTK" ); 

6. Run the TGB Editor as you normally do.  TSTK is installed. :)
