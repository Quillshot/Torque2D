There are two ways to install TSTK for use in your games.  One is easy, one is more difficult.

Installing TSTK for TGB Games (The Easy Way)
--------------------------------------------
1. Go to "http://roaminggamer.com/resources/torque/tgb-templates/"
2. Download and install any of the TGB game templates found there.
3. Create a new game using one of the templates.
4. Edit your game as you normally would. TSTK is installed. :)


Installing TSTK for TGB Games (More Difficult Way)
--------------------------------------------------
1. Locate the directory containing your current game.  This is usually something like "~\Documents\MyGames\MyGame\", where the last part of the directory name "MyGame" is whatever you called your game when you created it.
2. Copy "TSTK" into "~\Documents\MyGames\MyGame\game\"
3. Edit the file "~\Documents\MyGames\MyGame\game\main.cs".
4. Place this code at the top of the file:

exec("./TSTK/main.cs");
