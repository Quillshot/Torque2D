Installing TSTK for TGEA
-----------------------

1. Copy the folder "TSTK" from wherever you unzipped it into your TGEA "game" directory.  In these instructions, we'll assume you are using "C:\TGEA_1_8_1\GameExamples\TGEDemoAdvanced\".  Accordingly, you would copy "TSTK\" into "C:\TGEA_1_8_1\GameExamples\TGEDemoAdvanced\game\"
2. Edit the file "~\game\main.cs".
3. Locate the following lines:

$isDedicated = false;
$dirCount = 2;
$userDirs = "tools;" @ $defaultGame;


4. Change the above lines to:

$isDedicated = false;
$dirCount = 3;
$userDirs = "TSTK;" @ "tools;" @ $defaultGame;

5. Save "~\game\main.cs".
6. Run TGEA as you normally do.  TSTK is installed. :)
