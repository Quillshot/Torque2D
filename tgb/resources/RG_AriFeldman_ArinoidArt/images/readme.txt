This content pack contains one or more tile sets (and/or other resources) as originally found in Ari Feldman's SpriteLib_GPL.

In addition to these originals, modified versions of the original are present.  These versions have been modified to allow TGB to load them as tile maps.

The original SpriteLib_GPL (in its entirety) can be downloaded here:
